            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/5aBXbbd3VO0?si=S2NI6ISs887gtArk">The video of ICE killing a man today</a> is the worst thing I've ever seen.</p><p>There is no blood. It is not graphic in a traditional sense. The video is taken from a distance, you have to turn the sound on to understand what you are seeing. Or at least, I did. Sight alone wasn't enough for me to comprehend what I was witnessing: something I have never seen anywhere except for movies. That makes it worse. The killer saw movies. Life imitates art.</p><p>The man is subdued. He is on the ground, surrounded by agents. They are beating him, kicking him. An agent appears to take out his gun and pistol whip the man in the face. The man is kneeling, hunched over, an ICE agent behind him is holding him down. The man straightens his back and the agent who was pistol-whipping him shoots him in the head. The man jerks. The agent shoots twice more. As the man falls to the ground, likely already dead, the officer next to him unholsters his gun and empties his clip into the man's motionless body.</p><p>This is not a shooting, or even a murder. This is a street execution.</p><p><em>(EDIT: <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/sp296e.mp4">Here is a video from the woman in the pink jacket</a>, which provides context that makes what happened even more clear)</em></p><p>DHS says the executed man had a gun. I don't believe them because all they do is lie, and also I don't care. The man was subdued. Surrounded by officers. If those officers were unable to subdue him with the grip they had on him, it speaks to a total lack of training, an absolute failure of even the most basic knowledge of police work that renders them unworthy of carrying guns in the first place. The way that second agent empties his magazine into the man, like some victorious 12-year-old in Call of Duty, will haunt me until I die. I can't get it out of my head. </p><p>I am sitting at a truck stop in the middle of goddamn nowhere, halfway through Pennsylvania on I-80. 16 hours and about a thousand miles to Minneapolis. I was about a third of the way through this state when I got news of the execution. Stopped at Wal-Mart to stock up on supplies, watched the video. That was maybe an hour ago. </p><p>Whatever I'm feeling, I've never felt it before. I don't know what to do, but I know this is the right direction to drive, and that I can hardly bear to be still. So I'd better wrap this up, for my sanity and to maximize my chances of outrunning Winter Storm Fern.</p><p>These bastards. These motherfuckers. <a href="https://www.firewalledmedia.com/p/the-law-of-the-gun">This is war</a>. The Trump administration declared war weeks ago; it is unfolding before our eyes. This isn't the kind of war that involves armies on a battlefield, it's not conventional warfare. This is the goddamn Global War on Terror coming home to roost. It's a counterinsurgency against the American people, and we are all enemy combatants until proven otherwise.</p><p>The cruelty of it. Cold-blooded. Never in my life. What are we to do in the face of such evil?</p><p>I close my eyes, here at the truck stop, and think about the tens of thousands of people who protested in subzero temperatures in Minneapolis yesterday. I think about the thousands ICE could not frighten into silence and paralysis, who became MORE involved, more committed to opposition in the wake of Renee Good&#8217;s murder. These are the people who make me proud to be an American. Pride and rage. It has to be enough.</p><p>In the trunk of this rented Jeep Compass sits a suitcase full of gear from Portland in 2020. Military grade gas mask. Level 4 plate and a plate carrier that says PRESS. A kevlar helmet. These are things I hoped to never need again. I said at the time that the summer of 2020 in Portland and beyond was our modern Bleeding Kansas, a harbinger of worse things to come. I didn't want to believe it. I didn't want to be right.</p><p>These bastards do not understand the country they are trying to take over. They believe that we are all as cowardly as they are. They believe we will hide in our homes, that we will cease doing <a href="https://www.firewalledmedia.com/p/how-to-do-enough">the many things we can do and are doing to fight back</a>. They are wrong. </p><p>Fuck these people. Fuck their cruelty and their hubris. We cannot, will not stand for it. This is our country: an imperfect, fucked-up place with a beautiful dream and brilliant aspirations. They cannot kill that dream, not with all the bullets in the world; they cannot crush these aspirations to true greatness: equality, tolerance, a level playing field, a good and prosperous life for all. Liberty. Every single one of our amendments, our inalienable human rights. That dream will never expire, can never be snuffed out; it will continue, onward onward onward, and we will fight for that dream here and now and by God we will win.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.firewalledmedia.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.firewalledmedia.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

war?&#8221;</p><div><hr></div><p>If this sounds exaggerated or absurd to you here and now, in 2025, you&#8217;re right, but not in the direction you might think. None of these articles actually made it onto the front page of any of these papers. The New York Times article fell off their home page completely by noon. We are used to these things by now &#8212; so used to them that we can&#8217;t see what anyone from 2019 could tell you immediately:</p><p>We are no longer on the path to civil war. That war has already begun.</p><p><a href="https://www.bannedinyourstate.com/p/the-top-brass-disaster">Yesterday</a>, I wrote about some of the things Trump said to America&#8217;s highest-ranking military officers on Tuesday. How he plans to use our cities as a training ground for our armed forces, how he intends to invade us, one city at a time, until all unrest is crushed. I wrote about ICE&#8217;s escalating abductions and brutality without due process or oversight or limits of any kind, all across this nation, every day. </p><p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs">NSPM-7</a>, which commands America&#8217;s intelligence and law enforcement agencies to treat mainstream progressive beliefs as &#8220;indica of violence&#8221; &#8212; things like &#8220;anti-Americanism&#8221; and &#8220;extremism on gender.&#8221; This memorandum explicitly directs these agencies to target people and organizations who espouse such beliefs, even if they have committed no crime &#8212; all while the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/democrats-inspire-vicious-escalating-attacks-on-ice/">lays rhetorical ground</a> for declaring the Democratic party a terrorist organization.</p><p>Thanks to the government shutdown, only two branches of government remain functional &#8212; the executive branch and the judiciary. Trump made no effort to keep the government open; in fact, he did everything he could to ensure the budget measure failed. The traditional negotiations and frenetic rounds of last-minute voting were completely absent this time, save for a single eleventh-hour meeting between Trump and the two soggy rolls of paper towels that lead the Senate and House minorities. The President did not negotiate or take the discussion seriously; he instead <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5530758-jeffries-trump-2028-hats-white-house-meeting/">offered Schumer and Jeffries Trump 2028 hats</a>. A few hours later, he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115290424560405640">posted a deepfake</a> on Truth Social that featured Schumer and a mustachioed, sombrero-wearing Jeffries addressing voters while the Mexican Hat Dance plays in the background.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We h ave no voters left because of our woke trans bullshit. Not even Black people want to vote for us anymore. Even Latinos hate us. So we need new voters. And if we give all these illegal aliens free healthcare, we might be able to get them on our side so they can vote for us. They can&#8217;t even speak English, so they won&#8217;t realize we&#8217;re just a bunch of woke pieces of shit, you know?&#8221;</p><p>-Fake Chuck Schumer</p></blockquote><div

I received an <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/not-what-va-is-veterans-frustrated-by-email-blaming-democrats/YFBQTPQKN5F7PDWSUO24DHFWAU/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20opposes,unrelated%20policy%20demands.">email from the VA</a> explaining how the shutdown impacts my healthcare. &#8220;Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands,&#8221; it said &#8212; which is relatively tame compared to what some other agencies are doing:</p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b14d4ab5-d4d8-4769-a6f3-071eaef74c1d_642x452.webp&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e55a51f7-6328-4612-97dd-b1f76cb57729_798x520.webp&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f066cf16-afb4-4990-aba9-792b3bf12d11_798x565.webp&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4f4e3a33-3ba6-4dc1-8d11-9c3c08ba5ef9_785x559.webp&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42d99adb-ea32-4551-80d2-552b04a403ab_1456x1456.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p></p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a Choose Your Own Hatch Act Violation,&#8221; WUSA9 investigative reporter <a href="https://x.com/JordanOnRecord/status/1973441370569449730">Jordan Fischer</a> wrote when he posted these screenshots. <a href="https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/HatchAct-Federal.aspx#tabGroup12">The Hatch Act</a> is a law passed in 1939 that prohibits the civil service from doing&#8230;well...exactly this.</p><p>But laws don&#8217;t really matter anymore.</p><p>My friends, there is no ambiguity here. No plausible deniability as far as where we stand. Soldiers in our streets, policies that link dissent to terrorism, the dismemberment of our legal system and our constitutional democratic republic: <strong>The Executive Branch has declared war on the American people</strong>. Which means we&#8217;re now at war, whether we want to be or not. </p><p>The only choice that remains to us, to paraphrase <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/russ-vought/undercover-interview-project-2025-architect-gets-candid-initiatives-radical-goals-and#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20in%20the%20process%20of%20the%20second%20American%20Revolution%2C%20which%20will%20remain%20bloodless%20if%20the%20left%20allows%20it%20to%20be.%22">Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts</a>, is whether or not we fight back. And we must fight back &#8212; now, immediately, before these stories cease to make the headlines at all. </p><p>I am not calling for political violence or armed resistance. Blue cities have a far more powerful weapon in their arsenal than any martial weapon: we have money. Not just some money, or a lot of money, but damn near <em>all</em> the money. </p><p>In 2024, <a href="https://247wallst.com/news/2025/01/20/these-cities-have-bigger-economies-than-entire-us-states/">90 percent</a> of America&#8217;s <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP">$29.3 trillion</a> GDP came from urban areas. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NYNGSP">Over $2.3 trillion</a> of that money came directly from New York City alone &#8212; nearly eight percent, all by itself. Our ports provide a gateway into the world economy, imports and exports alike. We hear a lot about how America&#8217;s farmers keep the cities fed, and a lot less about how the taxes paid on that 90 percent share of GDP flow from our blue cities into their red, red countryside</p><p>Russ Vought <a href="https://x.com/russvought/status/1973386129320665329">plans to withhold $18 billion</a> of NYC&#8217;s federal infrastructure funding because he doesn&#8217;t want it used for &#8220;unconstitutional DEI principles.&#8221; Very cool: have we considered withholding our <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/reports/new-yorks-balance-payments-federal-budget-federal-fiscal-year-2023#:~:text=For%20the%2050%20states%20and%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%2C%20tax%20collections%20generated%20almost%20%244.3%20trillion%2C%20or%20%2412%2C802%20per%20capita%2C%20in%20FFY%202023.4%20New%20York%20generated%20approximately%20%24320.1%20billion%2C%20or%207.5%20percent%2C%20of%20this%20amount">$320 billion dollars</a> of annual federal tax revenue? The Trump administration doesn&#8217;t want to fund our infrastructure? Fntastic: let&#8217;s stop allowing them to use that infrastructure, deprive them of our ports and our rail lines. LA, Chicago, Portland and every other blue city can and should do the same, whether Trump has gotten to them yet or not.</p><p>I could not be more serious. There is no pathway back to normal, solid ground where norms and laws have meaning. An administration that executes Air Assault operations in downtown Chicago and officially declares that progressive views on immigration, race, gender, and sexuality <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs">&#8220;foment political violence&#8221;</a> is <em>not</em> going to respect the midterm results. I have tried to be gentle these last few months but at this point I&#8217;m going to need you to open your fucking eyes and see the world around you. Nine months is too long to be stuck in the denial stage.</p><p>Our only three options are violence, acquiescence, or economic sanctions. I don&#8217;t want violence, and acquiescence is out of the question. So let&#8217;s kick them where it hurts: right in the economy.</p><p>The logistics of economic defiance are formidable. Federal tax revenue goes directly to the federal government; it does not pass through the hands of the state. Our governors and legislative bodies will therefore have to get creative and put in the hard work necessary to either intercept federal taxes or nullify them. They will have to figure out how best to block federal use of our ports while still using them to supply our cities with necessities. But federal laws no longer apply to anyone, apparently, and I believe we can find a way. Most importantly, we can do these things without help or approval from the national Democratic party, which is good, because those chucklefucks are worse than useless.</p><p>Trump won&#8217;t take this kind of rebellion lying down. He may try to starve us out (which we would need to prepare for) or send active duty military into our streets to force our compliance at gunpoint. These actions would send us spiraling into an economic crisis that would make the Great Depression look like a market correction. It&#8217;s a nightmare scenario that I would prefer to avoid, but again: we are already at war, whether we want to be or not. Winning a war involves suffering and destruction: preferably the enemy&#8217;s but inevitably your own. There is no other way to win.</p><p>We cannot allow ourselves to grow silent and scared, heads bowed and eyes forward, inured to the pain and suffering of those around us. We cannot allow ourselves to become accustomed to night raids and terror campaigns and people disappearing into the Florida swamp like those <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article312042943.html">1800 human beings who simply vanished after Alligator Alcatraz shut down</a> &#8212; another story that barely broke the headlines and vanished almost immediately.</p><p>It&#8217;s so easy to forget. We have already changed so much since 2019, all of us. We have already lost something we&#8217;ll never get back, not all the way &#8212; it will be up to our children and our children&#8217;s children to fully reclaim it. ICE&#8217;s military raid on a Chicago apartment building barely cracked the news yesterday. George Floyd&#8217;s murder, which galvanized this nation five short years ago, wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance.</p><p>We are not just fighting for our neighbors. We are not fighting for abstract concepts of justice or freedom, or even for our lives. We are fighting for our <em>selves</em>, for the sanctity of our own souls. I will not become a dead-eyed corpse shambling through the wreckage of America. No sacrifice is too great. No price is too high.</p><p>America&#8217;s founders came to the same conclusion 249 years ago. Flawed as they were, they refused to bow their heads or bend the knee. We have a saying from our revolutionary past that encapsulates this sentiment, though two and a half centuries of causal use have trivialized and reduced its meaning. It was the final line of a speech, and <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/patrick.asp">that speech</a> is as true today as it was when first spoken in the Virginia capital.</p><blockquote><p>Let us not, I beseech you sir, deceive ourselves. We have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded&#8230;</p><p>&#8230;There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free-- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!</p><p>They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?&#8230;</p><p>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace-- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? <strong>Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me: <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/patrick.asp">Give Me Liberty, Or Give Me Death!</a></strong></p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.firewalledmedia.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.firewalledmedia.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded>
