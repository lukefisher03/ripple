<![CDATA[ <h2>Yes, Honda Did It First!</h2><p>Our recent article about <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ferrari/" rel="nofollow">Ferrari</a>’s <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ferraris-radical-oval-pistons-could-rewrite-the-future-of-gas-engines">pill-shaped piston patent</a> had a lot of readers commenting that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/" rel="nofollow">Honda</a> did it decades ago with their NR engine project. While Honda had their distinct reasons for going this route, and their execution was markedly different from what Ferrari is exploring, it is a fact that the Japanese manufacturer was the first to envision oval pistons and combustion chambers way back in the ‘70s. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzE2/honda-nr500-oval-piston.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Racing Drives Innovation </h2><p>Innovation <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/hondas-new-v3-engine-ditches-turbos-and-superchargers-for-something-smarter">in the internal combustion space</a> today usually revolves around creating cleaner, more efficient engines. The focus is on efficiency, emissions, downsizing, electrifying, or uncovering means to hold off obsolescence. In the mid-20th century, though, racing was the driving force behind motorcycle development, and Honda was one of the great innovators. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzI5/honda-nr500-gp-race.jpg" height="667" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>New Racing</h2><p>The brand dominated the sport with technologically-advanced, multi-cylinder, four-stroke machinery in the 1960s, eventually stepping away from motorcycle racing in 1968 to focus on developing and building <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/is-the-2026-honda-civic-sport-touring-hybrid-the-best-compact-sedan-made-today">passenger cars</a>. In the late '70s, after a hiatus of over a decade, founder Soichiro Honda wanted back in and set up the NR or New Racing project with the aim of competing in the Grand Prix Motorcycle World Championship, which is now <a href="https://www.motogp.com/en">MotoGP</a>, the premier class of motorcycle racing. </p><p>There was one problem: the sport was then dominated by two-stroke machinery. Soichiro Honda strongly disliked two-stroke engines, considering them noisy, inefficient, and unsophisticated, and set about attempting to create a revolutionary four-stroke motor that could outperform two-stroke engines of equal cubic capacity. The oval-piston engine, while legendary, is the result of this ultimately unsuccessful experiment.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMjky/honda-nr500-engine-display.jpg" height="761" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Honda</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Two-Stroke Supremacy </h2><p>Pound-for-pound, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/gm-is-working-on-a-modern-two-stroke-engine-that-could-make-a-comeback">two strokes</a> can make much more power than four strokes simply because they fire twice as often and complete the entire combustion cycle twice as fast — in one rather than two full crank rotations. To put this into perspective, the last time we saw two- and four-stroke machinery compete in the same class, it was 990cc four strokes and 500cc two strokes sharing the grid in 2002 and ‘03. But four strokes didn’t get these displacement allowances back in the ‘70s and ‘80s. </p><p>The rules were simple: no more than four cylinders, no more than 500cc in displacement. And the team of engineers at Honda’s NR project was faced with the problem of how to build a four-stroke motor that could ingest, combust, and expel air (and fuel) twice as fast as previously thought possible.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzMw/honda-nr500-engine.jpg" height="800" width="1194"> </figure> <h2>Valve Area Woes</h2><p>The answer to Honda’s problem was simple, on paper at least. A two-stroke engine sees twice as many power strokes as a four-stroke engine spinning at the same RPM. So, to match a two-stroke motor’s power output, a four-stroke would have to spin twice as fast. The successful two-stroke race machines of the time were <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/lamborghini-temerario-10000-rpm-v8-sticking-around-two-life-cycles-maybe-more">spinning up to over 10,000 rpm</a> and creating upwards of 120 hp; Honda set itself a target of 23,000 rpm and 130 hp, and got to work. </p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzMz/four-valve-head-gemini_generated_image.jpg" height="800" width="865"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/why-hondas-most-ambitious-engine-had-to-fail">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><p>There are many physical limitations standing in the way of how fast an engine can spin, but to even stand a chance, Honda’s engineers had to first come up with a way to pump enough air through a 500-cc four-cylinder motor to sustain itself at <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-ferrari-f40s-turbo-dna-lives-on-in-lamborghinis-10000-rpm-supercar">stratospheric revs</a>. More valve area was the need of the hour, but space was limited within the confines of a round, capacity-limited cylinder. Honda couldn’t increase the size of the combustion chamber to accommodate more valves, but the rules didn’t say anything about its shape. And so the oval combustion chamber was born, crafted to accommodate eight lightweight valves per cylinder for a total of 32 valves for this unique V4 motor with the breathing capacity of a V8.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzY1/honda-nr-head-chatgpt-image-2.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Reinventing the Wheel</h2><p>Piston engine combustion chambers have always been round, simply because this smooth, uniform shape offers the best seal. Trying to change this tried and tested design to accommodate more valves was akin to reinventing the wheel, and threw up a whole lot of issues during development. One was maintaining a seal within the cylinder for the duration of a race — oval piston rings had to be developed to tackle this, and their manufacture at the required tolerances pushed the limits of the time’s machining capabilities. </p><p>Another issue was the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/engine-teardown-reveals-surprising-problems-inside-toyotas-3-5-liter-v6">excessive rocking of an oblong piston</a> as it changed direction; this was countered by the incorporation of two connecting rods per piston, but an undesirable side effect was more weight and reciprocating mass. Even the piston wrist pins had to be inordinately long to cover the distance between the two connecting rods, and these longer pins could flex under the extreme forces of high-rpm operation. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzMx/honda-nr750-piston.jpg" height="800" width="610"> </figure> <h2>Going Racing</h2><p>The first time Honda’s NR500 saw the grid was at the 1979 British GP; unfortunately, both bikes entered failed to complete the race, and were utterly outclassed by the two-stroke competition. The bike continued racing for the next two seasons as the engineers attempted to further refine and make it more competitive, ultimately getting the motor to rev up to 19,500 rpm and generate 130 hp. This, however, was not enough to make up for the weight of the complex motor, and the experimental NR500 failed to leave a mark on the championship. Honda finally gave in, retired the oval-piston NR500 in early 1982, and focused on developing the NS500 three-cylinder two-stroke machine that eventually won the 1983 championship. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzM0/honda-nr500-gp.jpg" height="781" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>A Failed Experiment?</h2><p>Yes, Soichiro Honda failed at proving that a four-stroke motor could compete with two strokes on equal footing, and spent an inordinate amount of time and money in doing so. While the NR project didn’t have the desired impact on racing, it did make massive contributions to motorcycle technology. The need to manufacture small parts to extremely precise tolerances drove the development of better machining technology, while the NR500 also pioneered the use of exotic metals, like magnesium and titanium, to save weight, as well as the use of a slipper clutch — something we see even on beginner bikes today. While the oval-piston NR500 engine wasn’t the racing success it was intended to be, its existence is a showcase of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/mv-agusta-brings-back-an-engine-design-missing-for-decades">internal combustion innovation</a> at its best.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzYw/honda-nr-crank-chatgpt-image-2.png" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>The Oval Piston Road Bike</h2><p>Honda may have abandoned their oval-piston race project in the ‘80s, but their engineers had successfully <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-concept-that-changed-range-rover-forever">proved that the concept worked</a>. And what better proof of concept than bringing this technology to a road-legal motorcycle. In 1992, Honda launched the NR750 — a limited-run halo product and tribute to the NR500 race project, equipped with the oval piston technology developed at the track over a decade ago. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzM1/honda-nr750.jpg" height="800" width="1095"> </figure> <p>Only around 300 were built, not for profit but to make a statement. Not as high-strung and hence less fragile than the 500cc race engine, the NR750 revved to 16,000 rpm and made 125 hp. Priced at around $60,000 in 1992 (around $138,000 in today’s money), it was one of the most expensive and exclusive motorcycles of the ‘90s, aimed at collectors who wanted to own a unique piece of engineering excellence. Today, this motorcycle commands almost mythical status and six figures when, and if, one comes up for sale. </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Great Era for Chrysler</h2><p>From a product standpoint, at least, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chrysler/" rel="nofollow">Chrysler</a> was doing pretty well for itself in the '00s. Never mind the fact that things were less rosy behind the scenes (ehem, Daimler-Chrysler), some of the models introduced that decade from both Chrysler and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/" rel="nofollow">Dodge</a><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/chrysler-brand-revival-future-models">remain memorable even today</a>.</p><p>Okay, not all of its products during that era were bangers, but do remember this was a time when the 300 came out. The minivans were also comprehensively redesigned, the Charger was reborn, and the Challenger staged a comeback. And, laugh all you want, the PT Cruiser was pretty successful, too. We wouldn't exactly call a car that sold 1.3 million times over a flop.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxNzQ0/2005-chrysler-firepower-concept-vehicle.jpg" height="798" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Chrysler</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Fancy Viper, Anyone?</h2><p>In the mid-'00s, Chrysler had a barrage of concepts ranging from realistic to downright wild. There was the Crossfire that eventually did reach production, as well as the extreme ME-412 that...didn't. Between those two was the Firepower, and there were promising signs that it was being built for real.</p><p>Presented at the 2005 North American International Auto Show, it was built on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/vin-001-and-002-ultra-rare-hurst-dodge-vipers-are-being-sold-as-a-pair">second-gen Dodge Viper</a> chassis. It was an elegant grand tourer with classic proportions: long hood, short deck, coke-bottle quarter panels, and graceful lines. Its exterior was penned by Brian Nielander, now Dodge's chief exterior designer, while the interior was designed by Greg Howell, currently leading <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/" rel="nofollow">Jeep</a>'s exterior design department.</p><p>Nielander told <em><a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a18202822/chrysler-firepower-first-drive-review/">Car and Driver</a></em> back in 2005 that the Firepower was "an Aston for the common man." Meanwhile, Trevor Creed, the senior vice president of Chrysler Group Design at the time, described the car as one that "provides luxury, refinement and sophistication blended elegantly with passion and performance."</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxOTc0/2189.jpg" height="600" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>C</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>More Prototype Than Concept</h2><p>Unlike most concepts, the Firepower was, by all means, a working vehicle. There aren't any crazy and unrealistic details, either. The body looked close to production, and the interior was functional for the most part. Most importantly, it had a proper engine in the form of a 6.1-liter Hemi V8 that would later be used in the 300C SRT8, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/dodge-charger-history-muscle-car-sedan-coupe">Dodge Charger</a>, and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/in-the-autoblog-garage-2009-dodge-challenger-se">Dodge Challenger</a>.</p><p>That engine was good for 425 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque, and was then hooked up to a five-speed automatic transmission. Aside from the chassis, the Firepower also used the Viper's suspension setup, along with other parts from Chrysler and Dodge's parts bin.</p><p>Performance stats from the manufacturer included a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.5 seconds, along with a top speed of 175 mph. Granted, its acceleration times can be matched by something like a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2025-volkswagen-golf-r-4-reasons-to-love-it-2-reasons-to-shy-away">Volkswagen Golf R</a> these days, but it was blisteringly quick by 2005 standards.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxOTc1/829201chryfpb.jpg" height="782" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Chrysler</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Production Plans and Eventual Cancellation</h2><p><em><a href="https://www.motor1.com/features/727472/chrysler-firepower-concept-viper-corvette-rival/">Motor1</a></em> reported that plans to put the Firepower in showrooms had progressed far. Thomas LaSorda, Chrysler CEO from 2006 to 2011, told <em><a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20060116/SUB/60113054/firepower-corvette-fighter-is-still-on-chrysler-s-agenda/">Automotive News</a></em> that the car was still on the agenda as of January 2006. However, it would be a disastrous year for Chrysler with massive losses and piles of unsold cars in inventory. Trevor Creed would deliver the bad news in December 2006, telling <em><a href="https://www.wardsauto.com/news/archive-wards-chrysler-extinguishes-firepower/769894/">WardsAuto</a></em> 'We're not doing Firepower. We just couldn't find a viable way to do it.'</p><p>The succeeding years would be even more challenging for Chrysler. The rocky DaimlerChrysler marriage would be dissolved in 2007, and the company was sold to Cerebus Capital Management. The 2008 global financial crisis further compounded the automaker's financial troubles, eventually forcing Chrysler into bankruptcy (again) the year after. It was eventually picked up by <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/fiat/" rel="nofollow">Fiat</a> to form Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which then eventually became Stellantis with even more brands joining the mix.</p><p>While it's sad that the Firepower didn't reach production, perhaps it was for the best. On paper, it was feasible given the common parts it had with several models. However, developing and building a low-volume niche vehicle had all the potential to worsen Chrysler's cash flow issues at the time. It also could've been launched smack dab in the middle of an economic meltdown, and selling a luxury grand tourer at that time would've been unwise or even downright insensitive. Still, at least the lone car built is still around, but it's still one of the biggest "what ifs" out there.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxNzQ1/2146.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p>Chrysler</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 9 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-badass-viper-based-chrysler-that-almost-made-it-to-production">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/kia/" rel="nofollow">Kia</a> K5 is one of the more desirable options in the generally conservative midsize sedan segment. Not only does it boast snazzy styling, but the base model is affordable and there’s a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/i-drove-the-2025-kia-k5-gt-heres-my-honest-review">spicy turbocharged model at the top of the range</a>, something its <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/2025-honda-accord-december-lease-deals">Toyota Camry and Honda Accord rivals</a> can’t match. If affordability is a priority, though, Kia is running two lease deals on the base K5 this month. Here’s a look at what’s available and how the deals compare to leasing the class-leading Camry.</p><p align="center"><strong><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2026-toyota-camry-vs-2026-kia-k5-differences">Related: 2026 Toyota Camry Vs. 2026 Kia K5: 5 Major Differences</a></strong></p><h2>This Month’s Kia K5 Lease Deals</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTMzMzc1/2026-kia-k5.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption>2026 Kia K5<p>Kia</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The Kia K5’s lease price starts at $279 per month over 24 months, with $3,469 due at signing. This deal specifically applies to specially tagged vehicles that qualify for $250 in bonus cash, and is exclusive to the base LXS trim. The deal excludes tax, title, licensing, and registration costs, but includes 10,000 miles annually. If you drive more than this, a cost of $0.20 per mile applies.</p><p>The other deal is for the same trim but costs $289 per month over 36 months, with $3,499 down. This one excludes the bonus cash, but is subject to the same mileage limit. Both of these Kia K5 leasing deals require lessees to take delivery by January 2, 2026. These deals are in California, so be sure to check <a href="https://www.kia.com/us/en/offers/landing" rel="nofollow">Kia’s special offers</a> for deals that may be different in your state.</p><p>If you’d rather buy than lease a Kia K5, the 2026 prices are as follows:</p><ul><li>LXS: $27,390</li><li>GT-Line: $28,390</li><li>GT: $33,490</li><li>EX: $34,890</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2026-kia-k5-sedan-pricing">starting price of the 2026 K5</a> is $1,610 less than the base Camry.</p><h2>Powertrain and Features</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE2OTg4/2026-kia-k5.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption>2026 Kia K5<p>K</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>Most Kia K5s have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Front-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic are standard, while all-wheel drive is optional. This powertrain gets the job done and efficiency is fair at 30 mpg, but it’s no match for the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2026-toyota-camry-trims-le-vs-xse">base Camry</a>, which is both more powerful and far more efficient.</p><p>If you go for the K5 GT, it has a 2.5L four-cylinder turbocharged engine with 290 hp and 311 lb-ft. Not only is it a lot quicker than any Camry or Accord, but the sporty eight-speed dual-clutch transmission makes the K5 GT surprisingly fun to drive for a family-friendly sedan.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE2OTg5/2026-k5.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption>2026 Kia K5<p>K</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The Kia K5 LXS featured in this month’s lease deals has 16-inch alloy wheels and LED headlights, but does without the LED fog lights and panoramic sunroof of pricier trims. Standard features on this base trim include cloth upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, a six-speaker <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/best-car-sound-systems" rel="nofollow">sound system</a>, front/rear parking sensors, forward collision warning, and smart cruise control. At the price, it’s a reasonable specification and similar to key rivals.</p><p align="center"><strong><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2026-toyota-camry-vs-2026-kia-k5-vs-2026-hyundai-sonata-5-major-differences">Related: 2026 Toyota Camry vs 2026 Kia K5 vs 2026 Hyundai Sonata: 5 Major Differences</a></strong></p><h2><strong>How Does The K5’s Lease Compare To The Camry’s?</strong></h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODk1Mjkx/2026-toyota-camry-nightshade.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption>2026 Toyota Camry Nightshade<p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>Including the initial payment, the Kia K5’s lease offers start at $10,165 (in total) over 24 months or a total of $13,903 over 36 months. The 2026 <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2024-toyota-camry-review" rel="nofollow">Toyota Camry</a> LE costs $14,660 to lease, but that’s over a longer 39-month period. Over 36 months, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/toyota-camry-luggage-test" rel="nofollow">the Camry</a>’s lease cost is $13,763, which is slightly below the K5’s 36-month lease cost.</p><p>Both cars are quite cheap to lease, but the Camry’s standard powertrain with better power (225 hp) and much better efficiency (51 mpg combined) make it a better deal in our view. If, however, you plan to buy one of these cars and keep them for a long time, the Kia has a superior 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty (five years and 60,000 miles for the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a>) and a lower starting price.</p><p><em>*Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

<![CDATA[ <h2>Performance Starts Here</h2><p>Despite the market shift toward prioritizing crossovers and SUVs, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/cadillac/" rel="nofollow">Cadillac</a> is going against the tide by continuing to sell sedans with the CT4 and CT5, with the latter offering a track-ready trim known as the V-Series Blackwing. General Motors recently shared behind-the-scenes footage showing how this performance luxury sedan is produced as it approaches the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/cadillac-ct4-and-ct5-future-sedans">end of its production run following the 2026 model year</a>.</p><p>All units are built at GM’s Lansing Grand River Assembly plant in Michigan, with the automaker remaining tight-lipped about the model’s year-to-year production figures. What is known is that the Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing—widely considered a spiritual successor to the CTS-V—was introduced for the 2022 model year as a direct rival to models such as the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/" rel="nofollow">BMW</a> M5.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNgnMp3D1iY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>The Last of Its Kind</h2><p>The BTS footage highlights how each unit moves through the paint shop before reaching the “marriage” stage, a process plant director Troy Comiskey described as the moment when the engine is joined to the chassis.</p><p>For reference, the CT5-V Blackwing is powered by a hand-crafted 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine producing 668 horsepower and 659 lb-ft of torque. This setup represents a significant step up from the non-Blackwing CT5-V, which uses a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 rated at 360 horsepower. As standard, the Blackwing sends power to the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission, making it one of the few remaining high-performance sedans still available with a stick shift—and the last to pair one with a V8—though a 10-speed automatic can be specified as an option.</p><p>GM also showcased several automated processes inside the plant, including robots applying a bead of sealant around the windshield and a mechanism known as the “multiple,” which simultaneously tightens all lug nuts to precise torque specifications in just a few seconds.</p><p>The automaker additionally highlighted the Cadillac House, where customers are introduced to the Curated by Cadillac program. Echoing programs such as the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/porsche/" rel="nofollow">Porsche</a> Exclusive Manufaktur, the initiative allows buyers to spec the CT5-V Blackwing with an <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/how-cadillac-invents-and-chooses-its-cool-car-color-palette-each-year">extensive range of colors</a> and bespoke customizations, resulting in one-of-one builds and a fitting farewell for the model.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMTgw/cadillac-ct5-v-blacking-production.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNgnMp3D1iY">General Motors</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>As the Clock Ticks Down</h2><p>At present, no reports confirm a direct Blackwing successor. However, the next-generation CT5 is expected to retain a combustion engine, reflecting Cadillac’s decision to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/7-brands-spark-end-of-the-ev-deadline-era">step back from its earlier plan</a> to transition entirely to electric vehicles by 2030. Its smaller sibling, the CT4, will not follow the same path and is set to be <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/cars-discontinued-for-2024-and-beyond" rel="nofollow">discontinued</a> after June 2026.</p><p>The 2026 CT5-V Blackwing carries a starting price of $98,900, while pricing under the Curated by Cadillac program begins at around $158,000.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMTc4/2022-cadillac-ct5-v-blackwing.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://news.cadillac.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2021/aug/0810-blackwing.html">Cadillac</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/inside-the-factory-where-cadillac-builds-the-last-manual-v8-sport-sedan">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>On the Rise</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/nissan/" rel="nofollow">Nissan</a> GT-R nameplate is one of the most legendary ever, and with such a storied history, it's hard to pick out which models are "the best." However, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/nissan-gt-r-successor-in-limbo-as-electric-supercar-plans-stall">the GT-R is taking a break</a> from production; the brand has not yet provided a concrete return date. This has led to a steady rise in prices for older models being sold on the market.</p><p>One of these models is the R33 Nissan GT-R, a car often <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/super-rare-r32-nissan-skyline-gt-r-nismo-for-sale-only-560-were-ever-made">overshadowed by the game-changing R32</a> (otherwise known as the original Godzilla), but in many ways, it is an improvement over it. A very rare version of the R33 is now on sale, and the spec it comes in makes it worth considering.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMjAy/nissan-gt-r-nismo-s1-2.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Cars and Bids</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>The Definitive R33</h2><p>Listed on <a href="https://carsandbids.com/auctions/9ayM1lk8/1996-nissan-skyline-gt-r-nismo-s1-specification?ss_id=defd7461-e1f9-4e7c-95fe-7bb8a660251c&ref=lr_1_1"><em>Cars and Bids</em></a> is a rare 1996 Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo S1 specification. The R33 itself is already quite the car, being an improvement of the legendary R32. This generation had a sophisticated chassis and the revered RB26DETT, a straight-six turbo engine that produced 276 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque stock. However, the S1-spec models have been known to push over 300 hp. It had a 5-speed transmission that sent power to the HICAS All-Wheel Steering System.</p><p>The particular car for sale is in a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2026-nissan-z-channels-inner-godzilla-with-new-heritage-edition">highly coveted Midnight Purple hue</a> (the definitive R33 color). It features aftermarket side skirts, a rear bumper, a carbon fiber spoiler, and a 400R-style front bumper. Rounding out the exterior are the gold 18-inch Rays Engineering Volk Racing TE37 Rims. </p><p>Inside this R33 are a couple of interesting Nismo parts like the seats, gauge cluster, and center console gauges. It also features a Momo steering wheel, an aftermarket shift knob, and a Sony head unit.</p><p>Diving deeper into the Nismo S1 specification, this upgrade package was introduced to improve the performance of the R33. Particularly, BNR34 Turbochargers, S1 Intake, S1 Manifold, S1 Camshafts, and enhanced cooling components. There are also a few S1 stickers applied to the exterior of the car.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMjAz/nissan-gt-r-nismo-s1-3.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Cars and Bids</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Buyers Beware</h2><p>One thing to note about this particular R33 is that it remains right-hand drive, and based on the odometer, it has done 71,000 miles. Prospective buyers should remember that it is <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/import-cars-eligible-2023-25-years-old">an imported vehicle</a> and may not meet emissions standards in some states. </p><p>According to the listing, though, the car is mechanically sound, with the only issue listed as exterior chips and scratches plus some interior wear. As of writing, there are three days left to bid, and the highest is currently at $75,000, so better hurry before someone else gets it before Christmas. Heck, we might even drop our own bid, too.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMjA0/nissan-gt-r-nismo-s1-4.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Cars and Bids</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 7 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/dear-santa-we-want-this-midnight-purple-nissan-skyline-gt-r-nismo-for-christmas">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Small Club Gets Smaller</h2><p>Picture the regular Rimac Nevera: just 150 units built, so rare that most people will never see one on the road. But Rimac didn’t stop there. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/rimac-nevera-r-reveal-pebble-beach-monterey-2000-rpm">Nevera R takes that scarcity further</a>, adding more power and a sharper focus on track performance, with only 40 examples available worldwide. If 40 cars still feels too common, Rimac has just narrowed the field even more.</p><p>Meet the Nevera R Founder’s Edition, limited to just 10 units worldwide. According to Rimac, the Founder’s Edition is a “deeper connection to what makes Rimac unlike anything else.” Of course, all 10 cars found owners within days, quietly offered to select individuals who wanted something even more personal than the standard Rimac hypercar.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxOTMw/nevera-r-founder-s-edition-5.jpg" height="800" width="1079"> <figcaption><p>Rimac</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What Makes the Founder’s Edition Different</h2><p>Underneath, the Founder’s Edition keeps the Nevera R’s core, with four electric motors producing up to 2,107 horsepower, armed with Rimac’s own torque-vectoring system. The numbers are as wild as you’d expect: 00-60 mph in 1.66 seconds, 268 mph flat out. In 2025, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/rimac-nevera-r-steals-back-impossible-koenigsegg-speed-record">the Nevera R set 24 world records</a>, proving that this low-slung electric hypercar is more than style or rarity.</p><p>What makes the Founder’s Edition unique is how owners get involved. Buyers fly to Rimac’s campus in Zagreb to spec their cars in person, working directly with Mate Rimac and his team. Instead of picking from a menu, they use real-time visualization tools to shape every detail. Outside, each car gets a two-tone paint scheme that follows the body’s lines, making the car look even lower. A razor-thin center stripe, just 0.08 inches at its narrowest, runs along the roof with subtle nods to Rimac’s tech-driven identity.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxOTI5/nevera-r-founder-s-edition-6.jpg" height="800" width="1101"> <figcaption><p>Rimac</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>A Very Exclusive Hypercar Circle</h2><p>The Nevera R Founder’s Edition is all about bespoke details in the cabin. Handcrafted leather upholstery, one-off colors, and embroidery that highlights Rimac’s milestones set each car apart. The seats are arranged asymmetrically, just like Mate Rimac prefers in his own car. Every interior is customized for the owner, not built around a standard template.</p><p>Rimac hasn’t announced pricing of the Nevera R Founder’s Edition, but the standard Nevera <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/a-rare-1-of-150-2-2m-rimac-nevera-just-lander-on-bring-a-trailer">already starts at around $2.1 million</a>, and the Nevera R costs even more. With just 10 Founder’s Editions and the perks that come with them, it’s safe to say this version goes far beyond the base price – possibly double. At this level, the wealthy owners are more than merely purchasing a car. They’re joining one of the most exclusive hypercar communities anywhere.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxOTMy/nevera-r-founder-s-edition-3.jpg" height="600" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Rimac</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 8 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/rimacs-newest-2107-hp-hypercar-is-the-rarest-nevera-of-them-all">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Cheap on Paper</h2><p>While base trims typically promise savings for car buyers, that long-held principle may not apply to the all-new <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2026-nissan-sentra-first-drive-review">2026 Nissan Sentra</a>. A recent report from <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/deals-articles/2026-nissan-sentra-the-cheapest-one-is-the-worst-deal"><em>CarsDirect</em></a> points out that buyers could actually end up paying more for the entry-level Sentra S than for the better-equipped mid-spec SV, largely because the base model is excluded from <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/nissan/" rel="nofollow">Nissan</a>’s current promotional financing offers.</p><p>Those incentives – including 4.9% financing for up to 36 months, 5.9% for up to 60 months, and 6.69% for up to 72 months – are limited to the Sentra SV, SR, and range-topping SL. Considering that the MSRP gap between the Sentra S and SV is only around $800, the lack of subsidized financing means the cheaper trim can become the more expensive option once interest costs are factored in. <em>CarsDirect</em> even noted that this pricing structure could “create a reason for shoppers to skip the S trim entirely.”</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzQx/2026-nissan-sentra.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/cars/sentra.html">Nissan</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What’s in the Package</h2><p>Starting at $23,845 (including destination), the Sentra S already forgoes several features included with the SV. These include 16-inch aluminum wheels, upgraded cloth upholstery, an additional USB port, and a larger 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. Stepping up to the SV also opens the door to optional upgrades, including a 10-speaker premium audio system, wireless phone charging, and a moonroof.</p><p>Buyers who choose the flagship SL receive even more exclusive equipment, including quilted TailorFit seating, an 8-speaker Bose audio system, standard ProPILOT Assist driver assistance, and a four-way power-adjustable driver’s lumbar support. </p><p>Regardless of trim, however, the Sentra – which competes in the compact sedan segment <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2026-nissan-sentra-vs-2026-honda-civic">against rivals like the Honda Civic</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a> Corolla – is powered by the same 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-four, producing 149 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent exclusively to the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission (CVT).</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzM5/2026-nissan-sentra.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/cars/sentra.html">Nissan</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Looking Beyond MSRP</h2><p>Since the Sentra S has less equipment, it is expected to depreciate more. <em>CarsDirect</em> noted that the base trim carries a residual value roughly 5 percent lower than the SV. In leasing terms, that means greater expected depreciation, which translates directly into higher monthly costs. On a 36-month lease, the Sentra S comes out to $312 per month with $2,572 due at signing, while the SV actually undercuts it at $309 per month with $2,499 due at signing. When adjusted for effective monthly cost, the SV is estimated to be about $5 cheaper per month, at $378.</p><p>While Nissan’s current financing programs help offset <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/redesigned-2026-nissan-sentra-is-a-bit-pricier-should-you-get-a-2025-model-instead">higher pricing for the newly introduced ninth-generation Sentra</a>, this analysis gives buyers a clearer picture of where the real value likely lies, especially for those considering the base trim.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMzM4/2026-nissan-sentra.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/cars/sentra.html">Nissan</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/buying-the-cheapest-2026-nissan-sentra-could-be-a-costly-mistake">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

Dubai-based outfit Venuum customized the SUV, and it is arguably one of the flashiest Purosangue builds seen so far.</p><p>In an Instagram post, Paul referred to the Purosangue as a “pre-fight gift,” adding yet another high-profile vehicle to his multi-million-dollar garage.

The Purosangue features extensive forged carbon fiber across the hood, front and rear bumpers, side skirts, and wheel wells. Yellow racing stripes accent the exterior, a theme that carries over to the brake calipers and into the cabin.</p><p>Inside, the interior is upholstered in a bold yellow finish contrasted by black accents. Perhaps the most striking modification is the headliner, which adopts a “starry sky” treatment similar to those <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2024-roll-royce-spectre-five-thoughts-review">found in Rolls-Royce models such as the Spectre EV</a> and the Phantom. </p><p>If the powertrain remains untouched, the Purosangue should still rely on the Italian marque's standard 6.5-liter naturally aspirated V12, producing 715 horsepower and 528 lb-ft of torque. It sends power to all four wheels via an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMTk1/jake-pauls-ferrari-purosangue-venuum.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSQ2hgTjQ9Z/?img_index=1">&commat;jakepaul on Instagram</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Built Different</h2><p>This build stands out, particularly since Venuum is best known for creating prototype projects finished almost exclusively in black, including an all-black Purosangue revealed last year. While the company didn't disclose the pricing, it wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02NUTk5c33gvkZpTjZi8pFDhyqnL3kpUCtZGWpEC1rMUY58ygxnn1ysY1jHimBC242l&id=100062986011970">Facebook post</a> that Paul’s vehicle was a one-off commission and “will never be repeated,” though, for reference, the Ferrari SUV already carries a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/580k-ferrari-purosangue-for-sale-with-1000-miles-is-a-rare-chance-to-skip-the-waitlist">starting price of around $400,000</a>.</p><p>Given that influencers often elevate their branding through high-profile car purchases, it would be no surprise if this Ferrari isn’t the last major addition to Paul’s garage. After all, alongside his streaming and entertainment ventures, he has continued to expand his boxing résumé, having even shared the ring with boxing legend Mike Tyson last year.</p><p>Unfortunately, he lost to Anthony Joshua in the boxing match, breaking his jaw in the process, but at least he got this Ferrari as a consolation.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMTk4/jake-pauls-ferrari-purosangue-venuum.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02NUTk5c33gvkZpTjZi8pFDhyqnL3kpUCtZGWpEC1rMUY58ygxnn1ysY1jHimBC242l&id=100062986011970">Venuum on Facebook</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/jake-paul-takes-delivery-of-a-wild-one-off-widebody-ferrari-purosangue-with-a-starry-headliner">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Top Safety Pick+, Finally</h2><p>When the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/" rel="nofollow">Tesla</a><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/tesla-cybertruck-first-look-interior-exterior-review" rel="nofollow">Cybertruck</a> was first introduced, most of the attention went to its sharp, angular design because who wouldn’t? It’s not every day we humans see something like that, and that’s part of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/want-to-know-what-tesla-is-doing-with-cybertrucks-that-dont-sell-spacex-has-em-all">truck’s apparent appeal</a>. The styling drew plenty of jokes and memes, but the bigger (and more important) question was about safety. Could a truck with so many hard edges protect both its passengers and the people around it?</p><p>Well, that has changed recently. The Cybertruck just earned the Top Safety Pick+ award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the group’s highest rating. That means it performed well in both crash tests and crash prevention. Tesla made sure everyone noticed the achievement in a very cheeky way.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cybertruck earns IIHS Top Safety Pick+ <a href="https://t.co/xJaKnoUBFE">pic.twitter.com/xJaKnoUBFE</a></p>&mdash; Cybertruck (@cybertruck) <a href="https://twitter.com/cybertruck/status/2000799053664444417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <h2>A Victory Lap on Social Media</h2><p>To highlight the result, Tesla posted a video on X featuring Matt Farah, who had previously questioned whether a stainless-steel truck could comply with current safety standards. The video put past doubts next to the new certification.</p><p>Behind the announcement is a real achievement, though the <a href="https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/Tesla/cybertruck-crew-cab-pickup/2025">IIHS award</a> was not automatic. Tesla had to make specific changes to the front underbody and footwell to improve protection in passenger-side small overlap front crashes. These updates helped the Cybertruck meet the tougher standards now required for the Top Safety Pick+ rating, albeit <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/why-teslas-cybertruck-and-model-3-didnt-get-iihs-top-safety-picks">only for units built after April 2025</a>.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Or1b9ZZ0E4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>But That's Not the Point</h2><p>Much of Farah’s criticism focused on pedestrian safety and the truck’s exterior design. To be fair, the Cybertruck received a Good rating for pedestrian front crash protection – primarily because its driver aids are effective at preventing crashes – but its hard edges remain a major concern. That is also why the Cybertruck will not be sold in Europe. European rules are stricter about these things.</p><p>Speaking to <em><a href="https://topgear.nl/autonieuws/techneut-van-tesla-legt-uit-waarom-de-cybertruck-niet-naar-nederland-komt/">Top Gear</a></em>, Tesla vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy summed it up: European rules require a 3.2mm (0.13-inch) rounding on protruding parts, something that’s not feasible with a 1.4mm (0.06-inch) stainless steel plate. In other words, the Cybertruck can ace US crash tests, but it's not allowed elsewhere – a fact that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/teslas-bulletproof-cybertruck-gets-rejected-by-germany-over-basic-safety">even the US military couldn't sidestep on</a>.</p><p>The Cybertruck is now officially safer than many expected for its occupants, and Tesla has earned recognition from both the IIHS and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Still, questions about how its design affects people outside the vehicle are not going away.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMTU1/tesla-cybertruck.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-earns-top-safety-rating-after-everyone-said-it-couldnt">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Toyota Gets Sued Again For Its Faulty Automatic Gearbox ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ Toyota can’t seem to catch a break in court lately. Last month, the company dealt with a $5.7-billion lawsuit over the hydrogen-powered Mirai, with owners saying the car was basically unusable because there’s nowhere to refuel. Now, Toyota’s back in the hot seat, but this time it’s about something ... ]]>

Last month, the company dealt <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/toyota-sued-for-5-7-billion-over-mirai-hydrogen-cars">with a $5.7-billion lawsuit over the hydrogen-powered Mirai</a>, with owners saying the car was basically unusable because there’s nowhere to refuel. Now, Toyota’s back in the hot seat, but this time it’s about something significantly more common: automatic transmissions.</p><p>The <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/texas/txedce/4:2025cv01389/242430">latest lawsuit</a> was filed this month in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, led by a Camry owner named James LeBoutheller. He says his car’s transmission started acting up, but every time he brought it to the dealer, he was told it was just “normal operation.” Only after things got worse did someone finally find metal shavings in the transmission fluid – a clear sign something inside had failed. By that point, Toyota apparently refused to pay for the full repair.</p><p>The lawsuit claims Toyota kept selling cars with a known transmission defect and didn’t warn buyers about the risk.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA5MTMwNDg3OTg1ODc0Nzg4/2020-toyota-camry-xse.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What the Lawsuit is Actually About</h2><p>The heart of the issue is Toyota’s UA80 eight-speed automatic. According to the lawsuit, it’s got both a mechanical flaw and software that doesn’t help matters. The result? Too much heat, parts wearing out early, and transmissions that eventually give up. It is said that the transmission is “predisposed to premature failure” due to overheating, degraded fluid, and internal component wear, which may occasionally cause stalling or loss of power.</p><p>The lawsuit covers a wide range of vehicles, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2024-toyota-camry-review" rel="nofollow">Toyota Camry</a> (2017–2024)</li><li>Toyota Highlander (2017–present)</li><li><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/rav4/" rel="nofollow">Toyota RAV4</a> (2019–present)</li><li><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2024-toyota-grand-highlander-review" rel="nofollow">Toyota Grand Highlander</a> (2023–present)</li><li>Toyota Sienna (2017–2020)</li><li>Toyota Avalon (2019–2022)</li><li><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/lexus/" rel="nofollow">Lexus</a> ES 350 (2019–present)</li><li>Lexus ES 250 (2021–present)</li><li>Lexus RX 350 (2023–present)</li><li>Lexus NX 250 / NX 350 (2022–present)</li><li>Lexus TX 350 (2024–present)</li></ul><p>Owners say Toyota tried to quietly fix the problem with service bulletins and behind-the-scenes updates, all while still <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/toyota-claims-insane-number-of-vehicles-on-the-road">advertising these cars as reliable</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA5MTMwNzA2NDkzOTA4NTky/2019-toyota-rav4.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Not the First Time, and Likely Not the Last</h2><p>This isn’t just a one-off case, either. Earlier this month, another <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/5-million-usd-lawsuit-defective-toyota-automatic-transmissions">class-action lawsuit popped up in California</a>, asking for about $5 million over the same UA80 transmission. The complaints are almost identical: Toyota knew about the problem, repairs cost a fortune once the warranty runs out, and help from the company is hit or miss.</p><p>In both cases, owners point to online complaints, NHTSA filings, and dealership acknowledgments as evidence that Toyota was well aware of the issue. The Texas lawsuit expands the scope by pushing for nationwide class certification and broader remedies, including <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/toyota-recalls-camry-and-corolla-cross-hybrids">warranty extensions or recalls</a>.</p><p>What happens next is fairly predictable. Toyota is expected to file a motion to dismiss or narrow the claims, while plaintiffs will push for discovery to access internal documents. Whether these cases gain traction or eventually consolidate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the UA80 transmission isn’t done causing headaches, for owners or for Toyota.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTU1MTcx/2026-toyota-grand-highlander-lineup.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/toyota-gets-sued-again-for-its-faulty-automatic-gearbox">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Familiar Sedan, Slightly More Expensive</h2><p>Midsize sedans might not be the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/america-is-falling-out-of-love-with-the-honda-accord">hottest ticket in America right now</a>, but the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/" rel="nofollow">Honda</a> Accord is sticking around. For 2026, Honda played it safe – tweaking just enough and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/reveal-2026-honda-accord-more-tech-bigger-wheels-tiny-price-increase">keeping price bumps very minimal</a>. That strategy keeps the Accord in the running against the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2024-toyota-camry-review" rel="nofollow">Toyota Camry</a>, which still leads the pack, especially as buyers get pickier about value.</p><p>Line up the 2025 and 2026 prices, and you’ll see the increases are barely noticeable. Honda left the trim lineup mostly untouched, and most price jumps are in the low hundreds. Just note, the figures here don’t include the $1,195 destination charge that applies to both years.</p><div><table><thead><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Trim</p></td><td><p>2025</p></td><td><p>2026</p></td><td><p>Difference</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>LX</p></td><td><p>$28,295</p></td><td><p>$28,395</p></td><td><p>$100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SE</p></td><td><p>$30,560</p></td><td><p>$30,695</p></td><td><p>$135</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sport Hybrid</p></td><td><p>$33,655</p></td><td><p>$33,795</p></td><td><p>$140</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>EX-L Hybrid</p></td><td><p>$34,940</p></td><td><p>$35,095</p></td><td><p>$155</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sport-L Hybrid</p></td><td><p>$35,375</p></td><td><p>$35,495</p></td><td><p>$120</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Touring Hybrid</p></td><td><p>$39,300</p></td><td><p>$39,495</p></td><td><p>$195</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>On paper, the 2026 Accord doesn’t really ask much more from your wallet. That alone might make it easy to just go for the newest model. But with plenty of 2025s still on dealer lots, the real question is whether those minor updates are worth skipping out on some serious discounts.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTI5/2026-honda-accord-se.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Honda</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>2025 Inventory Still Has Breathing Room</h2><p>Looking at <a href="https://www.cars.com/shopping/results/?include_shippable=true&makes%5B%5D=honda&maximum_distance=all&models%5B%5D=honda-accord&sort=list_price&stock_type=new&trims%5B%5D=honda-accord-lx&trims%5B%5D=honda-accord-se&year_max=2025&year_min=2025&zip=33101"><em>Cars.com</em></a> listings paints a clearer picture of why the outgoing model year deserves attention. Gas-only trims, in particular, remain widely available and aggressively priced.</p><p>For example, there are about 2,135 units of the 2025 Accord LX still out there, with the lowest prices starting at $24,877 and average discounts of around $2,000. That’s a solid cut below MSRP, putting the base Accord well under its sticker.</p><p>The SE trim tells an even clearer story. With roughly 5,200 units still listed, prices drop to $27,500, and average discounts are close to $4,000. That not only wipes out the price difference to the 2026 model, it actually swings the deal in favor of the 2025 – especially if you’re not chasing the newest technology updates. Dealers appear motivated to move 2025 stock, so that's something customers can take advantage of.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTc1/2026-honda-accord-se-19-inch-wheel.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Honda</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What You Lose If You Opt for MY2025</h2><p>Going for the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2025-honda-accord-4-reasons-to-love-it-2-reasons-to-think-twice">slightly older but still brand-new Accord</a> means missing out on a few 2026 updates, though none are deal-breakers. The newer one offers a larger set of wheels, more tech features, and updated infotainment on select trims.</p><p>However, the basics stay the same, such as powertrains, ride comfort, cabin space, and fuel economy. If you care more about value than having the latest features, the 2025 Accord’s discounts could easily outweigh the small tweaks in the 2026.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTgx/2025-honda-accord-touring.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Honda</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/honda-accord-is-only-a-bit-pricier-for-2026-should-you-get-a-2025-model-instead">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Another Blue Oval Recall Joins the Long List</h2><p>Not too long ago, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> had to recall over 270,000 trucks and crossovers because of a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/recall-ford-rollaway-f150-lightning-maverick-mustang-mach-e#:~:text=Ford%20recalls%20272%2C645%20vehicles%20due,and%20notifications%20aren't%20immediate.">park module issue that could let vehicles roll away</a>. That included the F-150, Maverick, and Mustang Mach-E. Now, Ford is back with another recall, this time aimed at its heavy-duty trucks.</p><p>Ford is recalling a number of 2026 Super Duty trucks – <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-warns-115000-super-duty-owners-of-dangerous-steering-defect">specifically the F-250 and F-350</a> – over rear axle shafts that could fracture. Unlike an electronic glitch, this issue involves a critical mechanical component. If it fails while the truck is on the move or parked without the parking brake applied, the consequences could be far more serious.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA5MDg4ODY0NjUzOTQ0NDMy/2023-ford-f-250-stx-package.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>What Went Wrong and What’s at Risk</h2><p>According to the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25V866-5556.pdf">safety recall report</a> published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a total of 6,819 trucks are potentially involved in this latest Ford recall. The affected vehicles were built between October 2 and November 5 of this year, and are equipped with a 10.5-inch rear axle. Most of the population consists of F-250 models, with a smaller number of F-350s included.</p><p>The issue is with the right-rear axle shaft. Some of these shafts went through the heat-treatment process twice but missed a proper quench, which makes them more likely to crack. The supplier behind the part is Mid-West Forge Corporation.</p><p>If the axle shaft breaks, the truck could <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmws-top-electric-models-could-lose-power-while-driving">suddenly lose power</a>. There’s also a chance it could roll away if parked without the parking brake. Both situations raise the risk of a crash. Ford says to watch for rear axle noise or less power in two-wheel-drive as possible warning signs.</p><p>Ford first spotted the problem during internal impact tests. As of early December 2025, there haven’t been any reported accidents or injuries because of this defect, according to Ford.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE3ODQ5/2026-ford-f-350-super-duty-1.jpg" height="800" width="1180"> <figcaption><p>Ford</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What Owners Should Do Next</h2><p>Starting in January, owners will get a letter telling them to bring their trucks to a Ford or <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/" rel="nofollow">Lincoln</a> dealer. Technicians will check the right-rear axle shaft and replace any questionable parts at no cost. Dealers will use date stamps on the axle flange to spot the affected parts, not the VIN.</p><p>Until the inspection is done, Ford says owners should use the parking brake and steer clear of any chance of a rollaway. With <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/recall-ford-escape-detaching-liftgate-hinge-covers">all the recalls Ford has had this year</a>, the company is probably hoping this Super Duty issue is the last one for 2025. But with 10 days left, anything can happen.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTA5ODk2/2025-ford-super-duty-truck-04.jpg" height="712" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Ford</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-super-duty-trucks-recalled-for-axle-shaft-that-could-break">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>GM Leads The Unwanted List</h2><p><em>Consumer Reports</em> has listed the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/least-reliable-car-brands-america" rel="nofollow">least reliable</a> new SUVs based on findings gathered from more than 380,000 vehicles reported by car owners. While <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> has faced scrutiny this year after issuing over 140 recalls (<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/recall-ford-rollaway-f150-lightning-maverick-mustang-mach-e#:~:text=Ford%20recalls%20272%2C645%20vehicles%20due,and%20notifications%20aren't%20immediate.">and counting</a>), none of its SUV models made the 2026 list, unlike last year, when General Motors was the most frequent offender. This time around, General Motors is the most frequent offender.</p><p>In the compact SUV category, CR named the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2025-chevrolet-equinox-4-reasons-to-love-it-2-reasons-to-think-twice">Chevrolet Equinox</a> as the least reliable model, along with its <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/gmc/" rel="nofollow">GMC</a> counterpart, the Terrain. According to owner feedback, both models experienced issues with the transmission computer, severe fluid leaks requiring complete transmission removal, and recurring problems with the body control module. </p><p>Another GM entry appears in the three-row midsize SUV segment: the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2024-gmc-acadia-first-drive-review" rel="nofollow">GMC Acadia</a>, which earned poor marks due to transmission-related faults, leaks that necessitate gearbox removal, brake issues, and persistent problems with in-car electronics.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5KNIMgxC90" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>One Entry in a Crowded Field</h2><p>Stellantis landed a single entry on the list with the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/" rel="nofollow">Jeep</a> Grand Cherokee in the midsize SUV category. Owners cited a range of concerns, including steering and suspension problems, unusual noises, and fluid leaks. The model was also flagged for drive system issues, a problem that mirrors <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/nearly-92000-jeep-grand-cherokee-hybrids-recalled-for-sudden-power-loss-risk">recalls issued earlier this year</a> involving certain 4xe plug-in hybrid units that could unexpectedly lose propulsion while driving.</p><p>Rounding out the mass-market portion of the list is the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/" rel="nofollow">Volkswagen</a> Taos, which was identified as the least reliable subcompact SUV again this year. According to the report, the Taos was plagued by major engine-related problems.</p><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a>—which ranked 21st overall in an <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/the-winners-and-losers-of-consumer-reports-2026-rankings">earlier CR brand reliability ranking</a>—stood out as the only brand with models appearing in the luxury SUV category. The Genesis GV70 luxury compact SUV was reported to have issues involving the fuel pump, drive system, climate control system, and body hardware. Meanwhile, the larger GV80 luxury midsize SUV faced an even broader range of concerns, including problems with the differential, fuel pump, fuel injection system, climate controls, steering, suspension components, and various electrical accessories.</p><p>These findings were particularly noteworthy given that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hyundai/" rel="nofollow">Hyundai</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/kia/" rel="nofollow">Kia</a>, Genesis’ corporate siblings, earned 12th and 10th, respectively, in the brand reliability rankings this year.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMjYy/2022-jeep-grand-cherokee.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.jeep.com/grand-cherokee.html">Jeep</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>A Little Caution Goes a Long Way</h2><p>Among all-electric SUVs, CR once again pointed to a GM product, naming the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet</a> Blazer EV as the least reliable model in its class. Reported issues included faults with the EV battery system, climate controls, electrical accessories, in-car electronics, and recurring noises or leaks. One owner even recounted that a “battery sensor detected a fault and disabled the battery system on Thanksgiving.”</p><p>With the average price of a new vehicle in the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-average-new-car-price-is-now-over-50k-in-the-us-and-evs-are-to-blame">U.S. hovering around $50,000</a>, reports like this can serve as a valuable resource for consumers shopping for their next SUV, especially those hoping to avoid repeated service visits and unexpected breakdowns.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIyMjYz/2025-gmc-terrain.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.gmc.com/suvs/terrain">GMC</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 5 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/these-are-the-worst-new-suvs-you-can-buy-according-to-380000-owners">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Cleaner Solution to a Dirty Problem</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/porsche/" rel="nofollow">Porsche</a> has been working on a new way to help you <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/catalytic-converter-theft-top-vehicles">keep your catalytic converter alive</a> and well, using the age-old method of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) alongwith modified ignition timing for a better way to handle catalytic converter regeneration. Traditional methods dump extra fuel into the engine to create heat and burn off harmful buildup in the cat-con. This wastes gas and, ironically, produces more emissions. </p><p>Porsche’s <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=DE468465884">catalytic converter patent</a> addresses this persistent issue by leveraging perhaps the most misunderstood engine technology in recent times. EGR technology has advanced to the point where the benefits usually outweigh the drawbacks, and this patent would appear to be the next step in refining the technology to further lower emissions, while maintaining engine outputs in the long run. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxOTY2/catalytic-converters.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> <figcaption><p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>How the Technology Works</h2><p>Porsche’s solution goes back to the basics: more heat in the catalytic converters equals a cleaner exhaust system that works more effectively, leading to better engine health, horsepower, and lower emissions in the long run. The system manipulates variable valve timing to push substantial volumes of exhaust gases through the combustion chamber during regeneration, resulting in the required temperatures for cat-con regeneration without needing to enrich the fuel mixture. This is achieved through aggressive valve overlap, the main difference from most <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/preventing-the-five-most-common-auto-repairs">regular EGR systems</a>. </p><p>Porsche also retards ignition timing during the regeneration process. While this temporarily reduces power output, it simultaneously lowers nitrogen oxide formation. The result creates favorable conditions for converter regeneration while the converter itself handles less workload. The ECU coordinates turbo boost pressure and throttle position throughout to make sure the driver can't tell when the regeneration process is underway.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA5MTU0MzQ4NDA3MzM0NTEy/36-liter-pentastar-v-6-adds-cooled-egr-for-model-year-2016.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> </figure> <h2>Real World Advantages</h2><p>No doubt EGR technology carries baggage from its early implementations, when primitive systems hurt performance and reliability. However, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/what-is-vtec">modern variable valve timing</a> has improved the concept. By routing exhaust through the engine multiple times, the system maximizes the effectiveness of each regeneration cycle, particularly valuable when exhaust temperatures run low.</p><p>This innovation could extend catalytic converter lifespan while reducing maintenance costs. The system promises seamless operation invisible to drivers, while preserving both performance and emission levels. The patent filing shows that Porsche's <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/porsche-is-keeping-combustion-alive-with-a-new-water-injection-system">committed to the internal combustion engine</a>, wringing efficiency from proven technologies with a twist that could work out better than new solutions.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Old Name, New Territory</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/" rel="nofollow">Jeep</a> has announced that the Gladiator is getting a new trim called Sahara, a name that will already sound familiar to longtime fans of the brand. The Sahara nameplate has been part of the brand since 1988, having long been <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/i-drove-the-2025-jeep-wrangler-sahara-heres-my-honest-review">offered on the Gladiator’s SUV counterpart</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/jeep-wrangler-luggage-test" rel="nofollow">the Wrangler</a>, and now finally expanding to the pickup lineup.</p><p>Rather than leaning into the hardcore off-roading theme that defines trims like the Rubicon, the new Sahara adopts a more comfort-focused approach. Positioned squarely in the middle of the lineup, the trim is designed to add refinement without overlapping with the role of the Gladiator Rubicon X. In that sense, the Sahara mirrors mainstream trims such as the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> F-150 XLT, which cater to buyers who want an upscale presence and everyday usability without breaking the bank.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxNzc4/2026-jeep-gladiator-sahara.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=27338&mid=1">Stellantis</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Refined Touches on a Rugged Truck</h2><p>Visually, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/jeep-gladiator-discount-price-savings" rel="nofollow">Jeep Gladiator</a> Sahara distinguishes itself with body-colored fender flares and a matching body-colored three-piece hardtop. These elements replace the black exterior accents that typically emphasize the off-road-first character seen in the entry-level Sport and the trail-focused Rubicon. The Sahara also rides on a set of 18-inch aluminum wheels wrapped in <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/best-all-season-tires" rel="nofollow">all-season tires</a>, though Jeep notes that buyers can opt for all-terrain rubber at no additional cost (late availability).</p><p>Inside, the Gladiator Sahara features McKinley leather-trimmed seat surfaces, a material also offered on the Sport S. The package further adds a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, a 7-inch digital instrument cluster, and a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Additional standard equipment includes LED headlamps and fog lamps, remote start functionality, and remote keyless entry, reinforcing the Sahara's comfort and convenience appeal.</p><p>While the official press release does not explicitly detail the powertrain, the Sahara should retain the Gladiator’s standard 3.6-liter Pentastar V6. It produces 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, with power sent to all four wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. The company had previously planned to offer a plug-in hybrid 4xe variant for the truck, but the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/jeep-pulls-the-plug-on-gladiator-4xe-hybrid-pickup">program was canceled earlier this year</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMzQz/2026-jeep-gladiator-shadow-ops.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=27330&mid=1">Stellantis</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>The Middle Ground</h2><p>Jeep offers the 2026 Gladiator Sahara from $47,125, excluding the $1,995 destination charge. That figure undercuts the Rubicon by roughly $5,000. The Sahara bundle incorporates $4,685 worth of equipment borrowed from the Sport S, yet costs only $2,210, which the automaker says represents a 53 percent value advantage.</p><p>Alongside the Gladiator Sahara, Jeep is also closing out the year with another newly introduced <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2026-jeep-gladiator-shadow-ops-first-midsize-truck-with-factory-winch">off-road-oriented package known as Shadow Ops</a>. Based on the Rubicon, the Gladiator Shadow Ops features heavy-duty steel bumpers and a factory-installed winch.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMzM1/2026-jeep-gladiator-shadow-ops.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=27330&mid=1">Stellantis</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-jeep-gladiator-just-got-a-softer-side-with-this-new-47k-trim">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/rolls-royce/" rel="nofollow">Rolls-Royce</a> Spectre is supposed to glide around in near silence, but <a href="https://www.mansory.com/cars-for-sale/rolls-royce-spectre-mansory-linea-d-oro">Mansory</a> decided that simply would not do. Its latest take on the electric coupe, part of the Spectre “Equista” program and shown here in the over-the-top Linea d’Oro spec, adds a wide-body carbon kit, 24-inch wheels, gold detailing and, most notably, external speakers tucked under the rear bumper that blast fake combustion-engine noises to the outside world. <br><br>On a six-figure EV built to be quiet, it is pure theater, and very on-brand for a tuner that have already done their business with a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-900000-mansory-rolls-royce-cullinan-pushes-luxury-to-the-extreme">Cullinan SUV</a>.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDQ2/mansory-rolls-royce-spectre-1_result22.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-1-6m-electric-rolls-royce-has-speakers-that-blast-fake-engine-noise">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>An Electric Rolls With “Exhaust” Speakers</strong></h2><p>Mechanically, Mansory leaves the Spectre’s powertrain alone. You still get Rolls-Royce’s dual-motor setup with roughly 585 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque, good for a 0–62 mph time in the mid-four-second range and a WLTP range just north of 300 miles. The strange part lives in the rear diffuser, where Mansory integrates speakers aimed outward to play synthesized engine sounds as you drive. <br><br>The factory car already has the usual pedestrian-warning noise, but this is explicitly a “fun” add-on designed to give the big coupe some of the drama you would normally associate with a V12. The choice fits Mansory’s broader habit of giving already loud cars an <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/mansory-bmw-m5-shares-a-surprising-feature-with-the-ferrari-f40">extra punchline</a>. Compared to that, an electric Rolls with fake “exhaust” seems almost restrained, at least on paper.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDUx/mansory-rolls-royce-spectre-11_result22.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-1-6m-electric-rolls-royce-has-speakers-that-blast-fake-engine-noise">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>Gold, Carbon And A Not-So-Subtle Widebody</strong></h2><p>Visually, there is nothing restrained about the Spectre Equista Linea d’Oro. The stock coupe’s smooth surfacing is buried under a full carbon widebody kit that includes a vented hood, a more aggressive front bumper with larger intakes, deep side skirts, widened fenders and a race-style rear diffuser with a central rain light. The 24-inch forged wheels sit right at the edge of those flares, and the whole car rides lower, giving it a stance closer to a GT race car than a factory Rolls.<br><br>The Linea d’Oro treatment adds gold to almost everything: grille surround, bumper elements, side trims, diffuser details and pinstripes along the body. Inside, white leather with gold piping, custom quilting and Mansory logos covers most of the visible surfaces, with matching metallic accents on vents and switchgear.

<![CDATA[ <h2>So Close to the Plus</h2><p>The 2025 <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/acura/" rel="nofollow">Acura</a> ADX fell short of earning the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s (IIHS) highest Top Safety Pick+ rating, a distinction achieved by its <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/2025-acura-adx-vs-2025-honda-hrv">platform sibling, the Honda HR-V</a>. Instead, the ADX received the Top Safety Pick award, which still reflects a strong overall performance in crash testing.</p><p>To qualify for the coveted Top Safety Pick+ designation, a vehicle must earn “Good” ratings in all three crashworthiness tests (the small overlap front, updated moderate overlap front, and side impact tests), while also scoring at least “Acceptable” in front crash prevention (pedestrian/vehicle-to-vehicle) and headlight evaluations. While Acura's newest subcompact crossover scored “Good” in both the small overlap front and side tests, it earned an “Acceptable” rating in the updated moderate overlap front test, preventing it from securing the higher accolade.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXhknYJdnXA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Digging Into the Details</h2><p>A closer look at the <a href="https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/Acura/adx-4-door-suv/2025">IIHS report</a> shows that the ADX performed well in most areas of the moderate overlap front evaluation. It received “Good” scores across nearly all assessment categories, with the lone exception being rear passenger restraints and dummy kinematics, which were rated “Marginal,” the second-lowest score ahead of “Poor.” This criterion evaluates how effectively the rear seatbelt system manages occupant movement during a crash, including belt pretensioning and the rear-seat crash-test dummy’s motion and restraint during impact.</p><p>It is worth noting that the moderate overlap front test was updated in 2022 to include a rear-seat dummy, placing greater emphasis on second-row occupant protection.</p><p>In terms of crash avoidance and mitigation, the ADX earned “Good” ratings for both headlights and front crash prevention for pedestrians. However, it received an “Acceptable” score for front crash prevention in vehicle-to-vehicle scenarios. Much of this evaluation centers on AcuraWatch, the brand’s SAE Level 2 driver-assistance suite, which is comparable to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-solved-one-of-bluecruises-biggest-problems">Ford’s BlueCruise</a>. The AcuraWatch offers partial driving automation through features such as lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, and collision-mitigation braking.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxNjc5/acura-adx.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://acuranews.com/en-US/releases/release-c26685400737027f7d053958c303ed95-2025-acura-adx-earns-top-safety-pick-award-from-iihs?la=1&downloadUrl=%252Fen-US%252Fphotos%252FdownloadSource%253FidWithExtraText%253Dphoto-c26685400737027f7d053958c30401a1-30_2025-acura-adx-a-spec-with-advance-package-accessorizedjpg%2526dlid%253D934fa04fc5f425fceea0edc78ed0182ae36c9838">Acura</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>A Newcomer That Holds Its Own</h2><p>Additional IIHS evaluations awarded the ADX a “Good” rating for seat belt reminders, while LATCH ease of use was graded as “Acceptable.” According to the report, the tether anchors were difficult to locate, and some nearby hardware could be mistaken for anchor points.</p><p>Aside from the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/" rel="nofollow">Honda</a> HR-V, other 2025 model-year subcompact crossovers that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/the-safest-cars-of-2025-iihs-top-safety-picks">achieved the Top Safety Pick+ designation</a> include the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hyundai/" rel="nofollow">Hyundai</a> Kona and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2024-mazda-cx-30-review" rel="nofollow">Mazda CX-30</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/acuras-new-baby-suv-introducing-the-2025-adx">Acura offers the ADX</a> with a starting price of $35,000, and it comes standard with AcuraWatch and 10 airbags, including next-generation front driver and passenger airbags designed to help reduce head rotation during a collision.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxNjgw/acura-adx.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://acuranews.com/en-US/releases/release-c26685400737027f7d053958c303ed95-2025-acura-adx-earns-top-safety-pick-award-from-iihs?la=1&downloadUrl=%252Fen-US%252Fphotos%252FdownloadSource%253FidWithExtraText%253Dphoto-c26685400737027f7d053958c30401a1-30_2025-acura-adx-a-spec-with-advance-package-accessorizedjpg%2526dlid%253D934fa04fc5f425fceea0edc78ed0182ae36c9838">Acura</a></p></figcaption> </figure> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Strong Start for BMW’s New Era</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/" rel="nofollow">BMW</a> iX3 isn’t just another EV carrying the iconic roundel. It’s the first model on BMW’s brand-spanking-new Neue Klasse platform, and it has been <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmws-new-ix3-beats-x3-in-orders">proven to be a hit in Europe</a>. After its debut at the IAA Mobility Show in Munich last September, the iX3 has already outsold the gas-powered X3 in Germany.</p><p>That momentum appears to be unfazed despite the combustion engine’s recent win in the Old Continent. According to <em><a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2025/12/19/bmw-ix3-nearly-sold-out-europe-2026/">BMWBlog</a></em>, BMW Italy President and CEO Massimiliano Di Silvestre recently said that European demand has effectively absorbed almost all planned production for 2026.</p><p>"Our order backlog has far exceeded our expectations," Di Silvestre noted, adding that Europe alone makes up almost all of next year’s output.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTUwODY0/bmw-ix3---highway-driving.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>BMW</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Production Plans and Global Rollout</h2><p>Right now, all iX3s come from BMW’s new Debrecen plant in Hungary, which can build up to 150,000 vehicles a year. It’s not certain if they’ll hit that number right away, but BMW isn’t stopping there. Production of a long-wheelbase version starts in Shenyang, China, in 2026, and standard-wheelbase models will follow from San Luis Potosí, Mexico, in 2027.</p><p>Europe gets the iX3 first, with deliveries starting next spring. The US, meanwhile, will get its iX3 a few months later in the summer. The first version to arrive is the iX3 50 xDrive, but BMW plans to add more affordable rear-wheel-drive and smaller-battery options later on.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTUwODYy/bmw-ix3---siderear-profile-driving.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>BMW</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Arriving in America Packing Serious Numbers</h2><p>For American buyers, the iX3 50 xDrive <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/5-coolest-features-of-new-bmw-ix3">should start at about $60,000</a> when it arrives, featuring BMW’s latest Panoramic iDrive system and fast-charging tech. With two motors, it puts out around 463 horsepower and 476 lb-ft of torque. Charging is quick, too: at a 400 kW DC charger, you can add 175-230 miles of range in just 10 minutes. Going from 10 to 80 percent takes about 21 minutes if you find a high-power charger.</p><p>At the heart of the iX3 is a 108.7-kWh usable battery pack built on BMW’s new 800-volt architecture, a jump in energy density enabled by cylindrical cells. This battery supports up to 400 miles of EPA-estimated range on a full charge – a conservative figure compared to BMW's own test in Germany, where it <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/new-bmw-ix3-exceeds-epa-range-estimates">traveled over 621 miles on a single charge</a>.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTUwODYw/bmw-ix3---front-3-4.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 6 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmws-new-electric-x3-has-already-sold-out-for-2026-before-america-even-gets-it">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Land Rover's First-Ever Concept</h2><p>Believe it or not, Land Rover never made a concept vehicle until the mid-2000s. It's a bit of a surprise given that showing concepts was practically the norm by then. Back then, Land Rover would show a pre-production model at most, and maybe show a few design sketches here and there.</p><p>That all changed in January 2004 when the company revealed the Range Stormer Concept. It was shown during that year's North American International Auto Show, and it was Land Rover's way of flexing its design department, as well as showing the direction the brand was headed at the time.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5ODI1/1932.jpg" height="800" width="577"> <figcaption><p>Land Rover</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Greenlit From the Start</h2><p>Of course, we know the Range Stormer would eventually become the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/first-drive-2008-range-rover-sport">Range Rover Sport</a>. But prior to the creation of the concept, Land Rover already had plans to expand the Range Rover, er, range to create a line of vehicles under that name. Early mockups of the vehicle envisaged a three-door version of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-large-luxury-suv-will-always-be-the-perpetual-symbol-of-automotive-extravagance">full-sized L320 Range Rover</a>, and we must say it looked pretty neat.</p><p>Land Rover could've just shown the pre-production model of the Range Rover Sport, but the company wanted to make a bold, over-the-top statement to gauge reception for a sleek(ish), dynamic take on the much-loved British SUV. Sean Henstridge and Paul Hanstock were tasked to design it, under the direction of Land Rover's then design lead Richard Woolley. </p><p>Those old enough to remember its world premiere might recall that it created quite a lot of buzz back then. It was probably one of the stars of Detroit 2004, and it even appeared in some video games like the Gran Turismo series. Reception towards the Stormer was positive, and Land Rover had made the right call to build a Range Rover spin-off.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5ODIw/1926.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Land Rover</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Concept to Reality</h2><p>The Range Stormer was a working concept, but you might be surprised by its underpinnings. It was actually built on a shortened P38A chassis (the Range Rover from the mid-'90s), and had the classic Rover V8 under the hood. Of course, the real deal would share the same platform as the L319 Discovery 3, also known as the LR3 in North America.</p><p>There's a misconception that the eventual Range Rover Sport was an afterthought that utilized the LR3's chassis. The reality is, the L319 and L320 were developed around the same time. The Discovery 3/LR3 came out first, followed by the Range Rover Sport in 2005. The Range Stormer would also serve as the launch pad for Land Rover's Terrain Response system, with the Discovery and Range Rover Sport being the first products to get it.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5ODQ2/1946.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p>Land Rover</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Why No Three-Door?</h2><p>While the concept had three doors, it was ultimately decided to make the production a five-door only. It looked cool and all, but market research dictated that more doors were the way to go. Granted, the end result still looked relatively faithful to the concept, but we can't help but wonder if a three-door Sport would've made for a neat niche model.</p><p>According to <em><a href="https://www.aronline.co.uk/">Austin Rover Online</a></em> (a great repository of British car history, by the way), designers considered a rear half-door arrangement like the Mazda RX-8 and Hyundai Veloster. It was ultimately scrapped due to body rigidity concerns. Range Rover would later revisit that idea with the SV Coupe, but subsequently canned production plans. At least we have a three-door Land Rover in the form of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/how-the-defender-became-land-rovers-best-selling-model">Defender 90</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5ODIx/1923.jpg" height="800" width="1062"> <figcaption><p>Land Rover</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>A Pivotal Moment</h2><p>The legacy of the Range Stormer didn't just extend to the Range Rover Sport. It would help Range Rover be its own brand and embolden Land Rover to build more concept vehicles. Today, JLR has its 'house of brands, with Range Rover alone having four distinct models.</p><p>Aside from the full-size Range Rover, there's the Range Sport (4 generations), Range Rover Evoque (2 generations), and Velar (1 generation). It could be said that the brand's expansion wouldn't have been possible without the positive reception towards the Range Stormer Concept and sthe uccess of the Range Rover Sport.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5ODM2/1938.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5ODIz/1927.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> <figcaption><p>Land Rover</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 22 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-concept-that-changed-range-rover-forever">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A New Air-Cooled Porsche 911 Specialist Arrives</h2><p>We've had a fair share of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-1000-hp-dodge-charger-restomod-hides-a-carbon-weave-used-for-hypercars">seeing restomods</a> for quite some time now. Suddenly, it wasn't enough to have a plethora of supercar and hypercar options; extremely loaded enthusiasts were looking for more tasteful, exclusive classics, remade for the modern era.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-limited-edition-porsche-is-a-personal-tribute-to-the-inventor-of-the-911">Porsche 911</a> is probably the most-used platform for most notable restomod companies like Gunter Werks, Tuthill, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/singer-reimagines-porsche-911-carrera-coupe-2025">and Singer</a>. However, a relatively new challenger has just entered the arena, and it comes from the Land Down Under.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwNzc1/zeigler-bailey-4.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Zeigler Bailey 4.4 (Z/B 4.4)</h2><p>Australian company <a href="https://www.zeiglerbailey.com/">Zeigler/Bailey</a> (based in Melbourne) has unveiled its rendition of air-cooled 911s called the Zeigler Bailey 4.4 (Z/B 4.4), priced at a cool $1.6 million, which is <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ruehle-porsche-911-997-retromod">pricier than some Singer creations</a> we've seen. While the Z/B 4.4 looks like another in an already long line of 911 restomods, the company claims this one has its own set of differences.</p><p>For starters, it claims that its work is not a restoration of classic 911s, but rather a "complete re-engineering of one." It is, after all, designed from the ground up, featuring over 3,500 bespoke components – 1,200 of them were used for the engine alone. </p><p>One of the biggest challenges the company faced was adhering to the very strict Australian Design Rules (ADRs) and ensuring compliance with international standards. A key highlight of this build is the 4.4-liter hand-built flat-six engine, which produces 400 horsepower and 368 ft-lb of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 5-speed manual transmission, with a Le Mans-style pushrod suspension setup keeping bumps at bay.</p><p>The body of the Z/B 4.4 is a blend of carbon fiber and steel, and takes the form of a modernized 911 RS. It rides on 17-inch forged billet aluminum and carbon fiber hybrid wheels. </p><p>Inside the Z/B 4.4 is the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/porsche-resurrects-historic-fabrics-because-you-cant-beat-the-classics">classic tartan print associated with 911s from this period</a>, complemented by Nappa leather seats. It also features a touch of modernity through a 9-inch infotainment screen that has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus a reverse camera.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTY0/zeigler-bailey-44-zb-44-air-cooled-porsche-911-restomod---02.jpg" height="800" width="1099"> <figcaption><p>Zeigler&sol;Bailey</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Hands-On Exclusivity</h2><p>Zeigler/Bailey is keeping production numbers for the Z/B 4.4 low, claiming just 10 cars per year. What sets them apart from other builders is that this company actually wants owners to be hands-on during the build of their vehicle.</p><p>Owners are encouraged to lend a hand and get a better, more well-rounded picture of what it takes to create this model. In some instances, they can fit the cylinders into the engines, apart from a wide range of production processes they can help with.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTY1/zeigler-bailey-44-zb-44-air-cooled-porsche-911-restomod---01.jpg" height="800" width="1059"> <figcaption><p>Zeigler&sol;Bailey</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 6 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-1-6m-porsche-restomod-lets-owners-build-their-own-engine">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

Built by Caddyshack Golf Cars on an E-Z-GO chassis, this 2017 cart wears a full Camaro costume in Nightfall Gray, down to its fiberglass nose and tail and 50th-anniversary badging. <br><br>It recently traded hands on <a href="https://carsandbids.com/auctions/9lvZPmDO/2017-chevrolet-camaro-golf-cart"><em>Cars & Bids</em></a>, sold as a lightly used toy for someone who wants muscle-car vibes at 12 mph instead of 120. It is very different from the concours-correct hardware in <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/chevrolet-stars-and-steel-collection-corvette-silverado">big-ticket lineups</a>, but the brand loyalty is exactly the same.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5MTY1/_tsv0.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-golf-cart-looks-like-a-sixth-gen-chevy-camaro">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>Baby </strong>Camera Built on a Golf Cart</h2><p>Underneath the bodywork, this is still a 2017 E-Z-GO, not a street-legal Camaro. Power comes from a 48-volt battery pack and an AC electric motor driving the rear wheels, with the kind of relaxed performance you expect from a golf cart rather than a pony car. Hardware upgrades include independent front suspension, a limited-slip differential and 14-inch wheels, so it should ride more smoothly than the average fleet cart at your local course.<br><br>The Camaro look comes from custom-molded fiberglass front and rear fascias that mimic the sixth-gen car’s nose and tail. It is finished in Nightfall Gray with black and gray trim and orange accents, plus 50th-anniversary badges that tie it back to the full-size car. There is even an electric “frunk” up front for extra storage.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5MTY3/elpvp.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-golf-cart-looks-like-a-sixth-gen-chevy-camaro">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>Course-Ready Cabin With a Sense </strong>Of Humor</h2><p>Inside, the theme is “country-club Camaro.” The seats mix leather and cloth with orange inserts, the headliner is finished in suede, and there is a five-panel rear-view mirror for maximum visibility around the course. Practical touches include cup, ball and tee holders, a fold-down windshield for hot days and a rear mounting system for golf bags. It originally carried a window sticker of about $16,000 when new and recently received a fresh battery, which matters a lot more on a cart than mileage, since there is no odometer.<br><br>The condition is used but presentable: the listing notes scuffs and chips in the body, curb rash on the wheels and wear on interior trim and the driver’s seat. It is the same kind of honest patina you would expect on a classic Chevy that actually gets driven, whether that is a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/1970-chevrolet-nova-for-sale">1970 Chevrolet Nova</a> or a mid-year icon like a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/1967-chevrolet-corvette-sting-ray-for-sale-1">1967 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray</a>.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE5MTcz/3oppqymk-donyvrq.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-golf-cart-looks-like-a-sixth-gen-chevy-camaro">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>Novelty Value at a Huge Discount</strong></h2><p>This Camaro golf cart sold for $6,565, or roughly 60 percent off its original $16,090-ish MSRP. That is not cheap for a golf cart, but it is relatively modest for a fully finished, brand-themed build with fresh batteries and a pile of accessories, including sand bottles, covers, a charger and the original window sticker. <br><br>More importantly, it is the sort of thing that will get more attention in a gated community than a regular side-by-side or a plain fleet cart, especially if the fairways are already full of Silverado and Corvette owners.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Gas to electric and back to gas, again</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/porsche/" rel="nofollow">Porsche</a> is doing an awful lot of flip-flopping of late, and now the automaker's plan to electrify its next generation of 718 Cayman and Boxster sports cars has taken a surprising turn. After committing to an all electric future for its entry level sports cars, the automaker is now reportedly reengineering that electric platform to also support gasoline power. It is a rare reversal for Porsche and one that presents major technical challenges behind the scenes.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODk4MTE5/porsche-718-boxster-and-cayman.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2022/products/porsche-718-cayman-boxster-style-edition-30223.html">Porsche</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The next 718 was originally designed around an EV specific architecture intended to fully replace the current gas powered Cayman and Boxster. That platform integrates a large battery pack into the vehicle’s structure, using it as a load bearing element to improve stiffness and lower the center of gravity. From an engineering standpoint, this makes sense for an electric car. From a flexibility standpoint, it's quite the opposite, especially since going back to gas was never factored into the engineering.</p><h2>Retrofitting to a gas engine is painstakingly challenging</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTYwNTEz/photo-960513.jpg" height="800" width="1133"> <figcaption><p>Porsche</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>Electric first platforms are not designed with fuel tanks, exhaust systems, or traditional engines in mind. There is no natural place for a mid mounted flat four or flat six, no routing for exhaust plumbing, and no space allocated for fuel storage. Removing the battery pack entirely is not an option either, since it plays a key role in the chassis’ rigidity. Simply put, the EV 718 body was never meant to host a combustion engine.</p><p>Despite that, Porsche is now attempting to make it work, and it really has to with the pushback on EVs. Engineers are reportedly developing significant structural changes to allow a gasoline powertrain to fit within the same basic vehicle architecture. That includes new subframes, reinforced structural elements, and an entirely different floor layout to replace the stiffness lost when the EV battery pack is removed. The rear of the car, originally shaped around electric motors, must also be redesigned to support an engine and transmission while maintaining proper weight distribution. This is a tremendous undertaking, and it's not nearly everything.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEwMzMyNTk2NzE2OTcxMjEy/porsche-718-boxster-and-cayman-style-edition.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Porsche</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>Packaging remains one of the biggest hurdles. Porsche must find space for a fuel tank without compromising crash safety or driving dynamics. Exhaust routing has to work within tight confines, and cooling requirements for a combustion engine are very different from those of an electric motor. All of this must be done while preserving the sharp handling, low mass, and balance that define the 718 experience.</p><p>So why go through all this trouble? The answer appears to be demand. While Porsche remains committed to electrification, interest in electric sports cars has been slower to materialize than expected. Many buyers still want the sound, response, and emotional connection of an internal combustion engine, especially in a lightweight, driver focused car like the Cayman or Boxster.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>Rather than abandon its EV plans entirely, Porsche is taking a dual path approach. Electric versions of the 718 are still expected to arrive first, while gas powered models will follow later after the necessary engineering work is complete. This strategy allows Porsche to keep its options open while responding to market realities. Electrification is the future, but timing matters. For enthusiast driven segments, the transition may need to be more flexible than initially planned. Porsche has placed itself in a precarious position, but if anyone can figure it out, it's Porsche.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>In 1970, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/porsche/" rel="nofollow">Porsche</a>'s first overall victory at Le Mans was <a href="https://www.porsche.com/stories/innovation/why-the-porsche-917-is-a-gamechanger/">achieved with a 917 short-tail</a> bearing the number 23, and it was dressed in a striking red-and-white livery. This became known as the Salzburg Design, named after the Austrian city, and now, 55 years later, Porsche Sonderwunsch has brought it back. As part of a factory re-commissioning project, Porsche Sonderwunsch has redesigned and refreshed the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/porsches-legendary-carrera-gt-is-not-the-car-you-think-it-is">iconic Carrera GT</a>. The entire car was taken apart and overhauled, including the carbon fiber elements, which are now matte black, and the original silver finish was done away with, resulting in something that looks spectacular from every angle. But adapting the 917's livery for <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/porsche-carrera-gt-turns-back-time-the-untouchable-supercar-that-still-reigns-supreme">Porsche's 22-year-old supercar</a>, launched in 2003, was easier said than done.</p><h2>A Long Process to Realize an Enthusiast's Dream</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTA4/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design-factory-re-commission-41350.html">Porsche</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>Obviously, the shape of a modern road-going supercar is vastly different than that of a 55-year-old Le Mans prototype, so Porsche first had to sketch various reinterpretations of the livery before turning them into renderings and then taping the new lines onto the Carrera GT's body to ensure they would look as good in the metal as they did in the virtual world. Finally, hand-painting could begin. This included not only the Indian Red bodywork, but also the white accents, including the roundel with the number 23. Happily, the commissioning customer, one Victor Gómez, isn't planning to keep this as a work of art - he intends to put some miles on the practically reset odometer, getting the most out of the rebuilt 5.7-liter V10. Therefore, the body was protected with clear film.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTEw/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design-factory-re-commission-41350.html">Porsche</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The carbon mentioned earlier? That matte finish applies to the roof halves, the A and B pillars, the caps of the wing mirrors, the front air duct, the side skirt wings, and the rear diffuser, among other things, with a matte black anodized finish for the engine cover grilles complementing the overall theme. Similarly, the wheels have been painted matte black and accented with a red 'Carrera GT' script, while the black brake calipers bear the name of Porsche's special requests department, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/porsche-sonderwunsch-program-deep-dive">Sonderwunsch</a>.</p><h2>An Interior Blending Motorsport and Luxury</h2><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTEx/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design-factory-re-commission-41350.html">Porsche</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/porsche-sonderwunsch-carrera-gt-salzburg-design">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><p>Instead of leather, the instrument binnacle and other parts of the dashboard have been refinished in Alcantara, also in Indian Red, as were the door panels, steering wheel rim, center console, and front luggage compartment with its fitted luggage. For contrast, matte carbon reappears in the seat shells, the air vent covers, and the instrument cover. This mix of materials commonly used in motorsport and an eye-catching color seems like the perfect blend for a supercar with an engine concept that was initially intended for Le Mans competition, and there's further racing influence in the material used for the black seats. Here, black non-flammable FIA textile from the 918 Spyder finds a new home.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTEz/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design-factory-re-commission-41350.html">Porsche</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <p>All in all, this retro refinishing of the 603-horsepower Carrera GT is brilliant. While the livery and interior color combination pay homage to the historically significant 917, they also endow the awesome but aging supercar with a freshness that makes it look good enough to be relaunched today. Of course, if your bank account has close to or more than eight figures in it, you can commission something similar without going bankrupt.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTE3/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-carrera-gt-salzburg-design-factory-re-commission-41350.html">Porsche</a></p></figcaption> </figure> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Roaring Back From Extinction</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ram/" rel="nofollow">Ram</a> has released a new 15-second teaser for an unnamed product, paired with the tagline “Power Will Be Reborn.” The brief clip has sparked renewed speculation that the 1500 TRX could be on its way back, especially given the model’s former role as the brand’s flagship performance pickup, positioned to take on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> F-150 Raptor R.</p><p>Previously, the 1500 TRX was powered by a 6.2-liter supercharged Hellcat V8 producing 702 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. Those figures gave Ram a clear numerical edge over the early F-150 Raptor R, until <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2024-ford-f150-raptor-r-horsepower-numbers-more-trx">Ford later updated its performance off-road truck</a> to deliver 720 horsepower starting with the 2024 model year. </p><p>Before Ram could respond with an update of its own, production of the TRX ended, with the final unit produced in February 2024. The discontinuation was driven by several factors, including tightening emissions regulations.</p><p> https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pRPA4E_9lWU </p><h2>What’s Being Speculated</h2><p>Despite its exit, signs of a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/new-ram-1500-trx-returning-sooner-than-you-think">comeback began surfacing earlier this year</a>. During an earnings call, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa stated that the “V8 engine on versions, such as the Ram 1500 TRX, will deliver to us additional volumes.” While the newly released teaser appears to support that view, it offers very few concrete details beyond the aforementioned tagline and the caption, “Desert winds don’t whisper… they roar,” a likely nod to the Tyrannosaurus Rex that inspired the TRX nameplate.</p><p>Current rumors suggest the next-generation 1500 TRX could return with as much as 797 horsepower, putting it 77 hp ahead of the current F-150 Raptor R. That figure is believed to be tied to the Redeye-tuned version of Stellantis’ supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8, an engine already used in performance models such as the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/" rel="nofollow">Dodge</a> Charger. In its most extreme application, the same basic engine architecture has been pushed to 1,025 horsepower on E85, as seen in the Challenger SRT Demon 170. However, output at that level would likely be excessive for a full-size pickup.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxODQ0/2024-ram-1500-trx.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/me-en/ram/press/exclusive-2024-ram-1500-final-edition-marks-the-end-of-an-era">Stellantis</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>New Year Surprise</h2><p>But again, nothing's confirmed yet. Ram has only stated that the mystery product teased in the video will be officially revealed on January 1, 2026.</p><p>In the meantime, the Ram 1500 lineup already reflects a renewed openness toward combustion engines. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/hemi-v8-returns-to-2026-ram-1500">MY2026 is available with a returning 5.7-liter Hemi V8</a> paired with the brand’s eTorque mild-hybrid system, delivering 395 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque. Buyers can also opt for a high-output 3.0-liter twin-turbo Hurricane inline-six producing 540 horsepower. The broader reintroduction of V8 options underscores a shifting market landscape, which now appears more accommodating to internal-combustion powertrains rather than an all-in push toward electric vehicles.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxODQy/2024-ram-1500-trx.png" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p><a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/me-en/ram/press/exclusive-2024-ram-1500-final-edition-marks-the-end-of-an-era">Stellantis</a></p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ram-hints-the-1500-trx-could-return-within-two-weeks">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>More Than Just Gears</h2><p>From traditional manual gearboxes to hydrodynamic torque converter automatics, seamless CVTs, and even computer-controlled dual-clutch transmissions, we are spoiled for choice when it comes to how engine power is <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ferrari-delivers-brutal-blow-to-manual-lovers">delivered to the wheels</a>. Each design offers a unique blend of performance, efficiency, and driving feel, while some are better suited to certain conditions and applications than others. </p><p>Deciding on the right transmission for your car is a matter of understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each, acknowledging your own personal preferences and use case, and accepting that there is no perfect option for every driver and every vehicle. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE2OTEx/mini-shifter-2.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>The Simple and Involving Manual</h2><p>The obvious choice for the driving enthusiast, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/the-models-keeping-the-manual-alive-in-2025">traditional manual transmissions</a> have been around in various forms since the beginning of the 20th century. They are relatively cheap to produce, offer a strong sense of driver involvement, and are usually the most preferred for sporty driving. Since manual transmissions are completely controlled by the driver, they offer an extremely direct and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/manual-transmission-may-return-to-super-exclusive-ferrari-models">tangible human-machine connection</a>, but do demand a certain level of mastery and skill to get the best out of them. </p><p>The major downside with manual transmissions is the cumulative wear to the friction surfaces, primarily clutch plates and flywheels, over time. This wear can be exacerbated by improper driving habits, stop-and-go traffic, pulling a heavy trailer, or simply doing one too many starts on steep inclines where it becomes necessary to slip the clutch to get going. This is where automatics come in. </p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE2OTEz/bmw-z4-manual-shifter.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>BWM</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/why-theres-no-such-thing-as-the-perfect-transmission">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2>The Ubiquitous Automatic </h2><p>Since the 1950s, the overwhelming majority of cars sold in the U.S. have been automatics, with most of them being conventional <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/automatic-shifters">torque-converter automatics</a>. These rely on a fluid coupling and the power of hydrodynamics to transfer power to the wheels. The engine turns an impeller, which forces hydraulic fluid towards the blades of a turbine connected to the transmission’s input shaft, forcing it to spin. The engine’s power is hence transferred to the gearbox without a mechanical connection, and there are no friction surfaces to wear down. This makes torque converter automatics the ideal choice for harsh conditions, such as pulling heavy loads or crawling through stop-and-go traffic for extended periods. </p><p>Downsides include longer shift times and higher mechanical losses, leading to increased fuel consumption and emissions when compared with manuals. They also aren’t as involving to drive, but do offer a greater level of comfort by eliminating human error during shifting.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE2OTE2/bmw-8-speed-automatic.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>BMW</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>The High-Tech DCT</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/what-is-a-dct-dual-clutch-transmission">Dual clutch transmissions</a> combine lightning-fast shifts with the comfort of an automatic, while also keeping mechanical losses to a minimum. As the name suggests, DCTs feature two separate clutches and two input shafts, with the even-numbered gears on one and the odd-numbered gears on the other. While a gear is engaged on one of the input shafts, the next gear is preselected on the other, and a control unit alternates between them by disengaging one clutch and engaging the other. The result is almost instantaneous, seamless gear shifts that offer a sportier driving experience than a torque converter, but with the ease of use of an automatic. </p><p>Of course, since this system features mechanical clutches rather than a fluid coupling, it does incorporate friction surfaces that will wear out over time. It is also more expensive to produce than a manual or torque converter transmission. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE2OTE1/porsche-pdk.jpg" height="800" width="1091"> <figcaption><p>Porsche</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>The Seamless CVT</h2><p>Continuously variable transmissions do away with fixed gear ratios, replacing them with a pair of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/what-is-a-cvt">variable-diameter pulleys</a> connected by a belt or chain to provide an infinite range of ratios. This arrangement allows the engine to always operate either at its most efficient or most powerful rpm, resulting in smooth, uninterrupted acceleration as well as excellent fuel economy. CVTs are the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/sibling-rivalry-my-honest-review-of-the-2026-honda-hr-v-vs-2026-acura-adx">ideal choice for commuter cars</a> in urban settings, where efficiency, comfort, and refinement mean more than outright performance. </p><p>They can, however, feel disconnected and even somewhat unnatural, with engine speed changing independently of vehicle speed, and hence don’t usually appeal to the enthusiastic driver.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE2OTE3/honda-cvt.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Each type of transmission represents a different compromise between involvement, comfort, efficiency, durability, and cost. Manuals <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/surprise-the-c8-corvette-and-mustang-gtd-might-share-the-same-manual-gearbox">offer engagement</a> and demand skill, torque converters are great for everyday usability and stand up well to harsh usage, DCTs deliver lightning-fast shifts but are complex and expensive to build, and CVTs prioritise smoothness and fuel economy at the cost of driver enjoyment. As mentioned earlier, there is no on perfect transmission; the ideal one for you, however, is the one that best aligns with your driving and usage habits, expectations, and the road conditions you face. </p> ]]>

The tournament, set for April 27 through May 3, 2026, will be played on Doral’s storied Blue Monster course and televised across CBS and Paramount+, with additional coverage on Golf Channel and the Tour’s in-house platforms, including PGA Tour Live on ESPN+, SiriusXM, and the Tour’s World Feed. </p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE4NDk0/cadillac-pga-trump-doral.jpg" height="793" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>GM</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>“We are pleased to welcome back Cadillac, a world-class brand whose partnership with the PGA Tour is synonymous with Trump National Doral, a legacy venue on our schedule,” Brian Rolapp, the PGA Tour’s chief executive, said in a statement.</p><h2>Cadillac’s golf partnership goes back decades</h2><p>Cadillac’s ties to professional golf, and to Doral in particular, run deep. The automaker became the umbrella sponsor of the World Golf Championships in 2010 and later lent its name to the WGC-Cadillac Championship, a limited-field invitational that was contested at Trump National Doral from 2011 to 2016, reinforcing the venue’s status as one of the Tour’s marquee stops. While the previous incarnation was part of the World Golf Championships series, the 2026 tournament, staged as a Signature Event, carries a $20 million purse.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE4NDk5/2013-cadillac-world-golf-championship-01.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>GM</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>Yet Cadillac’s ties to the game stretch back even further. In the 1970s, long before corporate sponsorship became a defining feature of professional golf, Cadillac dealers were already underwriting marquee events like The Masters, with stars such as Arnold Palmer lending their names and their credibility to the brand.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE4NTA0/1975-cadillac-arnold-palmer-ad.jpg" height="800" width="627"> </figure> <h2>Doral: A South Florida staple</h2><p>Before Donald Trump bought it in 2012, the property was known as the Doral Resort & Spa, and is well-known for its golf courses, especially the Blue Monster. Not surprisingly, the course earned its moniker from its abundant, strategically placed water hazards built on what was once swampland. The golf club was founded by New York real estate developer Alfred Kaskel, who opened the Doral Hotel and Country Club in 1962 at a cost of $10 million, naming it for himself and his wife, Doris. The Doral Resort & Spa had gone through several owners, including <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/morgan/" rel="nofollow">Morgan</a> Stanley, before entering bankruptcy and being acquired by the Trump Organization.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE4NTA2/trump-doral-historic-brochure.jpg" height="488" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Trump National Doral Miami</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The PGA Tour’s 55-year history at Doral ended when it pulled out following the 2016 WGC-Cadillac Championship, when Cadillac ended its sponsorship. Finding a new sponsor proved difficult due to the polarizing political rhetoric of owner Donald Trump. The event was moved to Mexico, angering Trump, who criticized the PGA Tour as "disloyal” and characterizing the Tour as "stupid." No doubt his opinion will change his tune with the PGA Tour’s return to Doral. "We are excited to welcome Cadillac back – an iconic brand and a longtime friend – for the Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral, one of the most celebrated golf destinations anywhere in the world," said Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of The Trump Organization.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>Other automakers are heavily involved with golf partnerships, including <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/" rel="nofollow">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a>, and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/" rel="nofollow">Honda</a>/<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/acura/" rel="nofollow">Acura</a>. Cadillac has once more rejoined this exclusive corporate fraternity. “The Cadillac Championship builds on our legacy with the PGA Tour while connecting with luxury customers through culturally significant events,” said John Roth, global vice president, Cadillac. Those events include Monterey Car Week and Cadillac’s reinvigorated racing program.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE4NTEw/trump-at-doral-april-2025.jpg" height="800" width="1093"> </figure> <p>Trump National Doral is one of three Florida properties owned by Donald Trump, two of them clustered in Palm Beach County. It’s an unusually dense footprint that speaks to the intersection of real estate, branding, and geography that’s home to many Cadillac buyers and intenders. </p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Familiar Shape Returns With a Different Strategy</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/kia/" rel="nofollow">Kia</a> is back in the compact hatchback game after stepping away when the Forte5 left US showrooms in 2018. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/best-used-cars-to-buy" rel="nofollow">old car</a> never really caught on, and it looks like Kia learned from that. Instead of banking on nostalgia or trying to carve out a niche, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/kia-reveals-2026-k4-hatchback-your-crossover-alternative">new K4 Hatchback</a> goes straight for the value play.</p><p>To be sold alongside <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2025-kia-k4-4-reasons-to-love-it-3-reasons-to-think-twice">the K4 sedan</a>, We saw hints of the K4 Hatchback’s <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/kia-k4-hatchback-debuts-with-shockingly-low-price">low starting price last month</a>, and now Kia has made it official. For a brand-new compact hatch, the pricing is intentionally sharp.</p><p>2026 Kia K4 Hatchback MSRP (excluding $1,195 destination):</p><div><table><thead><th></th><th></th></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Trim</p></td><td><p>MSRP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>K4 EX</p></td><td><p>$24,890</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>K4 GT-Line</p></td><td><p>$25,890</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>K4 GT-Line Turbo</p></td><td><p>$28,790</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>That starting price lands below what most would expect for a fully updated hatchback loaded with current tech and safety features. Kia is clearly aiming for buyers who might have considered a Civic, Corolla, or Mazda3 but want more for their money. Now that the numbers are out, the real question is what you actually get for that base price.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkwMzQ3/2026-kia-k4-hatchback.jpg" height="719" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Kia</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What Comes Standard, and Where the Trims Split</h2><p>Even at the EX level, the K4 Hatchback arrives well equipped. All trims include a dual-digital cockpit, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a wireless phone charger, SynTex seating, and heated front seats. Kia also includes 16 standard ADAS features throughout the lineup, including Blind Spot Collision Avoidance Assist and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/smart/" rel="nofollow">Smart</a> Cruise Control with Stop & Go.</p><p>Step up to the GT-Line and you get sportier looks and unique suspension tuning just for the hatchback. The GT-Line Turbo brings a 1.6-liter turbo engine with 190 horsepower and swaps in an 8-speed automatic for the base car’s IVT.</p><p>Options like a heated steering wheel, Harman Kardon audio, Digital Key 2.0, and more connected features depend on the trim or package, but nothing feels tacked on. Kia made sure the standard kit feels solid, not stripped down.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkwNzgw/2026-kia-k4-hatchback.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Kia</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>How the Pricing Stacks Up Against Rivals</h2><p>Compared to its main rivals, the K4 Hatchback sits at the affordable end of the compact class. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/" rel="nofollow">Honda</a> Civic Hatchback <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/is-the-2026-honda-civic-sport-touring-hybrid-the-best-compact-sedan-made-today">starts a few thousand higher</a>, and both the Mazda3 and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a> Corolla Hatchback cost more once you match up the features.</p><p>Even the GT-Line Turbo, with its extra power, comes in below most rivals with similar specs. It might not define a new level for the segment, but it’s tough to overlook. Kia isn’t trying to reinvent the hatchback here – it just wants to make it easy for buyers to get a well-equipped car without stretching the budget.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkwNzg3/2026-kia-k4-hatchback.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Kia</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 10 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/what-do-you-get-with-kia-k4s-surprisingly-low-price-tag">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Quiet Send-Off at Louisville Assembly</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> announced <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-is-killing-the-escape-and-lincoln-corsair-heres-what-might-come-next">the end of the Escape and Lincoln Corsair</a> back in August, and now it’s official. The last Escape has left the Louisville Assembly Plant (LAP), closing the book on a model that quietly moved a lot of units for Ford over the years.</p><p>On the factory floor, the end hit home for the people who built these cars. Gregorio Mosiea, one of the team at LAP, took a picture of the last <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2025-ford-escape-3-reasons-to-love-it-2-reasons-to-think-twice">Ford Escape</a> to roll out of the assembly line, its body covered in signatures from everyone who worked on the popular nameplate. It was a simple send-off from the people who spent years on the line. </p><p>Mosiea added that as he left, crews in hard hats were already moving in, starting to strip out the old lines, which brings us to what will happen next to the factory.</p><iframe frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https://www.facebook.com/gregory.mosier/posts/pfbid03WiXGj7cbhJ4f7iRoQsvofwVa75fsAMpMpzDqx8TiBVhmxb6PU1ieFo4rFGiKJekl"></iframe><h2>Retooling the Louisville Assembly Plant</h2><p>With Escape and Corsair production complete, the Louisville facility is now headed into a major transformation. Ford is investing roughly $2 billion to retool the plant for a new mid-size all-electric pickup based on its Universal EV Platform, with production currently targeted for 2027. The plan was part of <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-updates-plans-5-new-affordable-vehicles-by-2030">Ford’s announced reset this week</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the change won’t be easy for everyone. About 2,000 workers will be off the job for close to 10 months while the plant gets reworked. UAW Local 862 is stepping in with partial pay and help finding temp jobs to get people through.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTkzMDM0/2026-ford-escape.png" height="677" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Ford</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>You Can’t Order One, But You Can Still Find One</strong></h2><p>You can’t order a new Escape from the factory, but they’re not gone from showrooms yet. Based on inventory listings found on <a href="https://www.cars.com/shopping/results/?include_shippable=true&makes%5B%5D=ford&maximum_distance=all&models%5B%5D=ford-escape&sort=list_price&stock_type=new&year_max=2026&year_min=2026&zip=33101"><em>Cars.com</em></a>, more than 14,000 <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2026-ford-escape-pricing-and-competition">new 2026 Ford Escape units</a> are still out there, mostly in the Active trim, both FWD and AWD.</p><p>Pricing is also softer than usual. Some examples are listed at around $23,600, roughly $6,000 below MSRP. That’s a huge cut, so if you’re shopping around for one, make sure to check dealerships' current inventory to find a good deal. You can also find <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/2026-ford-escape-lease-deals-december">lease offers for the final model year</a> if that's what you're after.</p><p>Availability does come with a catch: Escapes won’t be sold in states that follow California’s stricter CARB emissions rules, and Corsair sales there are limited to the PHEV Grand Touring.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTkzMDMz/2026-ford-escape-4.png" height="677" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-final-ford-escape-leaves-the-factory-with-a-proper-goodbye">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>There Are AWD Minivans, Then There's the Delica D:5</h2><p>AWD minivans aren't a new concept. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet</a> Astro AWD springs to mind when it comes to that. And let's not forget the quirky (but overheating-prone) <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a> Van 4WD from the '80s. There was a time when it was forgotten, but it's now enjoying a resurgence through the likes of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chrysler/" rel="nofollow">Chrysler</a> Pacifica and Toyota Sienna.</p><p>There's also no shortage of those over in Japan. If anything, all of the country's automakers offer an all-wheel drive option for their vans, in all shapes and sizes. But <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/mitsubishi-tokyo-concepts">it's the Mitsubishi Delica D:5 that stands out</a>, as it's always been known for its off-road capabilities. Okay, it's no Montero, but it's been in the off-road-ready van game for over 45 years now.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTE4/2002.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>New for 2026</h2><p>Notice we said "new" instead of "all-new"? That's because the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/mitsubishi-updates-2026-outlander-models-eclipse-cross">2026 model is still based on the same one</a> introduced way back in 2007. This minivan shares its underpinnings with the second and third-generation Outlander, the final Lancer, and is even distantly related to the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/" rel="nofollow">Dodge</a> Journey. Still, it's a hugely popular van in Japan, and anyone who's been there will attest to that.</p><p>So, what's new this time around? Probably realizing that more people went for the all-wheel drive model, the two-wheel drive trims have been dropped. The chunky cladding is included and no longer trim-specific, and there are tweaks to the front and rear fascias. Inside, there are enhanced interior materials and a new, fully digital instrument cluster. The advanced driver assistance also gets an upgrade, as does the all-wheel drive system.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDEw/2019.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>What Makes the Delica D:5 Unique?</h2><p>On the surface, it looks like a boxy minivan with body cladding to give it credentials it doesn't deserve. The thing is, the Delica's all-wheel-drive system is pretty clever, with some Evo DNA sprinkled in. But what sets it apart from other all-wheel-drive minivans is its drive-select modes.</p><p>Simply put, it's not something you can find in a Pacifica, Sienna, or any other all-wheel drive minivan in Japan. It has snow and gravel modes, although it doesn't have more serious modes like mud or rock. It does have a center-locking differential, though, something you'd want in off-roading. While <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/i-drove-the-2025-toyota-land-cruiser-does-it-work-as-a-daily-driver">it won't be scaring Land Cruisers on a trail</a>, it has enough hardware (and software) to hold its own on the rough stuff.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTIy/2013.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <h2>Other Highlights</h2><p>The powertrain is refreshingly old-school and defies the whole electrification movement. Under its hood is a 2.2-liter turbodiesel mill, and there's <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/toyota-says-youve-been-misled-most-hybrids-arent-really-hybrids">not even mild-hybrid tech</a> in it. It's simple, proven, and tried-and-tested. The compact diesel engine delivers 174 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque, so don't expect blistering acceleration. What's more important here is its pulling power.</p><p>Ground clearance is over 7 inches, which is actually more than some crossovers out there. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/mitsubishi/" rel="nofollow">Mitsubishi</a> is also quite proud of its approach and departure angles, really digging into the whole off-road minivan theme here. Speaking of which, there is no shortage of options to turn it into a factory glamper, from roof rails and baskets to neat storage solutions. Oh, and there's an optional rear-entertainment system, too.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDA5/2018.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTE3/2004.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 13 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-mitsubishi-minivan-has-a-locking-diff-and-off-road-mode">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The recalls just keep on coming for <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a> in 2025, and the latest means that your truck or crossover might not be where you left it. According to a recall filed with the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCAK-25V863-3736.pdf">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, vehicles from the 2022-2026 model years have an issue that could cause them to roll away after being put in park. The problem affects 272,645 vehicles, so it's not a small issue like the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/recall-2025-26-ford-escape-lincoln-corsair-seat-belt-retractors">Escape recall we covered yesterday</a>, and unlike yesterday's report, this one affects three different vehicles, both electric and combustion-powered. On the plus side, the fault can be easily resolved with an over-the-air update, so it's not mechanical.</p><h2>Which Vehicles Are Affected by Ford's Latest Recall</h2><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE4MDA5/2026-f-150-lightning-stx.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Ford</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/recall-ford-rollaway-f150-lightning-maverick-mustang-mach-e">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><p>The rollaway risk affects the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/i-drove-the-2025-ford-f-150-lightning-supercrew-heres-my-honest-review">Ford F-150 Lightning</a> (2022-2026), the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2022-ford-mustang-mach-e-review">Mustang Mach-E</a> (2024-2026), and the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/i-drove-the-2025-ford-maverick-xlt-awd-hybrid-heres-my-brutally-honest-review">Maverick</a> (2025-2026). The recall acknowledgement document says that "the integrated park module may fail to lock into the park position when the driver shifts into park," potentially allowing the vehicle to roll, which increases the risk of a crash. As noted above, a simple OTA update will address this software issue, but unfortunately, owner notification letters are only expected to be mailed on February 2, 2026, which is around the time Ford expects to have devised a remedy to the problem. Customers who want to determine whether their vehicle is impacted will have to wait until January 26 to search their VINs on the <a href="https://nhtsa.gov/">NHTSA's website</a>.</p><p align="center"><strong><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-now-charges-2026-mustang-mach-e-buyers-for-frunk">Related: Ford Now Charges Mustang Mach-E Buyers for a Frunk</a></strong></p><h2>Ford is on the Path to Redemption</h2><p>Ford has accumulated the most recalls ever amassed by an automaker in a single calendar year, and it <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-breaks-general-motors-infamous-recall-record">achieved that undesirable feat within the first six months of the year</a>, but it is working towards improving its reliability scores and is doing all it can to retain customers. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/5-changes-ford-making-to-correct-recalls-costing-it-billions">Various changes in quality control processes</a> should improve future vehicles, and in the meantime, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-offering-10-percent-incentive-to-retain-customers">Blue Oval is quietly offering discounts</a> to customers who may be thinking of moving to other brands. Hopefully, these measures will be enough for current and future products, of which there will be several. The automaker is responding to market demands by phasing out the current all-electric F-150 Lightning in favor of one with a range extender, as well as <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/next-ford-lightning-wont-arrive-until-2028-as-ev-plans-shift">working on a compact pickup</a>, a small SUV, and new vans. Of course, quality control improvements mean little if there's a software issue, but at least those are quick and easy to resolve.</p> ]]>

Here, we’ll round up the biggest news stories of the last 24 hours on <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/"><em>AutoBlog</em></a> and divvy them up into bite-sized chunks that get right to the heart of the story, allowing you to go deeper if you want.</p><h2>Dodge's electric Charger is getting more expensive by the minute</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTQxNjY5/charger-14.jpg" height="797" width="1200"> </figure> <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/">Dodge</a> has opened the order books for the 2027 Charger Daytona Scat Pack, and the big story is a substantial price increase. Dodge keeps calling it the "world's most powerful muscle car," which is somewhat cheapened, ironically, by its price point. The Charger does receive some updates, however. For 2027, Dodge equips all models with the North American Charging Standard (NACS) port and includes a J1772-to-NACS <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/best-bluetooth-car-adapters" rel="nofollow">adapter</a>. This provides owners with access to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/" rel="nofollow">Tesla</a>’s Supercharger network. Dodge says retrofit details for 2026 models will be announced in early 2026.

<![CDATA[ <h2>Not a Goodbye, At Least for Now</h2><p>Following reports that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/" rel="nofollow">Volkswagen</a> has paused production of the ID. Buzz in Germany, the all-electric minivan is now expected to skip the U.S. market for the 2026 model year. However, the move may be more strategic than permanent. A Volkswagen spokesperson told <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/12/vw-cancels-id-buzz-for-2026-as-dealers-warn-it-might-be-over/"><em>Carscoops</em></a> that skipping the 2026 ID. Buzz would allow the automaker to better support the current model year while preparing for a possible return in 2027.</p><p>The report added that Volkswagen is already preparing for what it described as an “MY27 transition next year,” though specific details were not disclosed. It also referenced a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VWIDBuzz/comments/1pq1th2/looks_like_the_vw_id_buzz_might_be_officially/">Reddit thread</a> in which a customer shared a message from a dealer suggesting the model had been <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/cars-discontinued-for-2024-and-beyond" rel="nofollow">discontinued</a>, an assertion VW has not formally confirmed. Taken together, these developments suggest the automaker may be reassessing certain aspects of the ID. Buzz in an effort to improve its market appeal.</p><blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="740"> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit-VWIDBuzz/comments/1p"></a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><h2>A Tough Crowd to Win Over</h2><p>One contributing factor appears to be demand. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/vw-pauses-id-buzz-production-amid-weak-sales-and-60k-price-tag?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ID. Buzz reportedly faced a production pause</a> amid slowing demand and shifting market conditions, particularly in the U.S., where established minivans such as the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chrysler/" rel="nofollow">Chrysler</a> Pacifica and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a> Sienna continue to dominate the segment. At the same time, broader pressures have made it more difficult to sell EVs, including the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/car-tariffs-rising-auto-prices-2026">higher import duties</a>. These factors have weighed on the ID. Buzz’s market reception, despite VW’s strong historical connection to the Type 2, also known as the Microbus in the U.S.</p><p>Pricing has also been a frequent point of criticism. The entry-level Pro S trim starts at $59,995, placing it roughly $20,000 above the starting price of a Toyota Sienna.

<![CDATA[ <h2>The Hemi V8 Is Back—And Buyers Wasted No Time</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ram/" rel="nofollow">Ram</a> didn’t make a big announcement when it brought the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/hemi-v8-returns-to-2026-ram-1500">Hemi V8 back to the 1500</a>, but word got out fast. The result? Orders poured in. The 5.7-liter Hemi had barely left before buyers made it clear they wanted it back, and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/rams-hemi-v8-comeback-triggers-ordering-frenzy">the rush to place orders proved it</a>.</p><p>The Hemi V8 doesn’t outshine the new Hurricane inline-six in raw numbers, but that’s not the point. It’s about the sound, the feel, and the sense of tradition that comes with a V8 under the hood. Tim Kuniskis, now back leading Ram, took a risk bringing it back. Judging by the early response, it was the right call.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTY2MjQ4/2026-ram-1500-57-liter-hemi-v-8-etorque-engine-bay.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Ram</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Demand Is the Easy Part</h2><p>Now Ram faces a different challenge: building enough Hemis to meet demand. Due to supply constraints, production is still ramping up, and Hemi trucks are moving off lots at more than double the pace of Hurricane-powered models. Right now, about 30 percent of Ram 1500s sold are Hemis – and that number could climb if supply catches up.</p><p>“We probably need, as a company, another 100,000-plus Hemis to meet consumer demand,” Kuniskis said in a media briefing, <em><a href="https://carbuzz.com/ram-boss-bad-news-about-hemi-v8-ramp-up/">CarBuzz</a></em> reports.</p><p>At the moment, availability is also constrained by trim selection. Only a couple of high-volume trims, primarily Big Horn and Laramie, are seeing consistent Hemi allocations. Other trims, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/discover-the-features-of-the-2026-ram-1500-warlock-serious-off-road-value-for-52k">especially the rugged Warlock trim</a>, technically support the engine, but finding one on a dealer lot can be difficult.</p><p>It’s an odd situation: the engine everyone wants is also the toughest to find, and buyers are willing to pay extra for it over the base V6 or the Hurricane six.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE0MTA0/2026-ram-1500-big-horn-57-liter-hemi-v-8-etorque.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Ram</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What Comes Next</h2><p>Ram expects Hemi supply to improve as production catches up. More trims will get the V8, and Kuniskis thinks the Hemi could make up nearly 40 percent of Ram 1500 sales. That’s not only about moving units – it’s about keeping loyal buyers in the fold, especially those who see a V8 as a must-have.</p><p>If you’re set on a Hemi-powered Ram 1500, don’t count on finding one sitting on a dealer lot. The best move is to order the exact truck you want, even <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/hemi-v8-returns-to-ram-1500">if it means waiting a bit longer</a>. Ram knows the demand is real. Now it’s just a matter of building enough to keep up.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTExOTA1/2026-ram-1500-black-express-with-hemi-v-8-front-34.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ram-cant-build-hemi-v8-trucks-fast-enough">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Charging an EV is still more affordable</h2><p>The EV market is in severe decline. Automakers, such as <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a>, are all but discontinuing production of electrified vehicles and are renewing a focus on hybrids. That’s due, primarily, to federal tax credits expiring and a relaxation of greenhouse gas reduction targets. EVs are roughly $11,000 more expensive than ICE (internal combustion engine) cars on average, and our faltering economic landscape makes swallowing that pill pretty difficult.</p><p>The rising cost of electricity is also problematic, but a new study shows that powering up an EV remains far less expensive than filling a gas tank. EVs can be charged overnight, when electricity demand is lower. Depending on your driving habits, an EV saves you quite a bit of money in the long run.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwNTYw/the-new-ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck.jpg" height="748" width="1200"> <figcaption>The Ford F-150 Lightning <p>John Tlumacki&sol;The Boston Globe via Getty Images</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Gas vs the “eGallon”</h2><p>Veloz, a nonprofit dedicated to education about EVs, recently released a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251211925054/en/The-Great-Debate-eGallon-vs-Gasoline">study</a> comparing the eGallon to a gallon of gasoline. It claims that, on average, it costs $43.00 to fill up “a standard” 14-gallon gas tank. This assumes the price for a gallon of gas is $3.07. The cost of gasoline varies widely by location, as state taxes and geographic factors affecting the transport of gasoline to stations can drive up prices.</p><p>The study claims the average cost to “fully charge” an EV at home is $12.86. As with gas prices, electricity prices can vary by geography and rise during periods of high demand. Charging overnight, for instance, is likely cheaper than trying to charge up at 2 pm on a hot day when electricity demand is high.</p><p>Though the study doesn’t break out the data, EV charging data seems to target an average EV battery size of 65–75 kWh. All told, Veloz claims that drivers pay an average of 5 cents per mile for an EV and 12 cents per mile for an ICE vehicle. But how much do the cost-of-driving savings get you?</p><h2>EV savings can pile up</h2><p>Veloz claims an EV costs roughly $30 less to fully charge than filling a gas tank. The average price of an EV is $11,000 higher than that of an ICE vehicle. To “break even,” a driver needs to charge their EV 367 times to mitigate the added upfront cost of an EV ($30 in savings per charge divided by $11,000). EV drivers also spend less on maintenance, but repairs are often prohibitively expensive.</p><p>If you’re a heavy commuter who would charge their EV fully every other day, your break-even point happens around two years after purchasing your EV. People keep the vehicles they purchase for about 5 years on average. That means that heavy commuters who charge fully every other day would save thousands of dollars annually in year three of ownership and each year thereafter. Plainly put, the “eGallon” comes out ahead the longer you own your EV and take care of it.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTk4NjI1/2026-ioniq-6-n.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>Car buyers are bad at looking at vehicle ownership through a long lens. It isn’t easy to accept the added cost of an EV, especially if you’re financing a vehicle at the high interest rates we’re currently seeing. The study also assumes homeownership, another major cost that many people are skipping due to interest rates and a slumping economy. 2026 will be an interesting time for the auto industry and EVs, no doubt.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Driving the arrow-straight highways that connect America's vast plains can be decidedly boring, particularly when the speed limits seem to extend the journey - and drivers' boredom. But if Arizona Rep. Nick Kupper has his way, the drive could become a little less mundane, especially if you're in something fast like a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2025">ZR1</a>. He has authored a bill (HB2059) that could remove speed limits on certain rural roads during the day and allow limits of up to 80 mph at night. <em><a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/rapid-act-would-lift-daytime-speed-limits-some-rural-highways-arizona.amp">Fox 10</a></em> reports that the new RAPID Act (Reasonable and Prudent Interstate Driving Act) is intended to promote the message of trusting your fellow driver, and Kupper told the outlet that his idea is based on similarly successful practices in Montana and Germany.</p><h2>A Pilot Period to Test the Idea</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTEyOTU0/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Chevrolet</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>Kupper argues that, in these derestricted zones in Montana and Germany, "roughly 83% of drivers stayed around 77 mph because that's where they feel comfortable," adding that drivers keeping a closer relative speed to each other compared to limited zones "is a major factor in why these zones are actually safer." However, there's a long way to go before the <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/2R/bills/HB2059P.pdf">House Bill 2059</a> is passed; first, there will be a year-long pilot program along a section of I-8. If all goes well there, other sections of qualifying interstate road could be derestricted. To qualify for no speed limit, the RAPID Act says that a road would have to be "outside an urbanized area with a population of 50,000 or more persons" and must have a crash rate over the last five years below the statewide average. Furthermore, the roads would need sufficient infrastructure, and the bill asks state highway and transportation officials to set the standards for what would be acceptable.</p><p align="center"><strong><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/patent-mclaren-locks-full-performance-behind-gps-based-track-only-mode">Related: Future McLarens May Make It Impossible To Hoon Anywhere But The Track</a></strong></p><p>But drivers would still need to behave responsibly: "A person shall not drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the circumstances, conditions, and actual and potential hazards then existing," notes <em><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/arizona-bill-considers-removing-speed-limits-from-rural-interstates">The Drive</a></em>. "A person shall control the speed of a vehicle as necessary to avoid colliding with any object, person, vehicle or other conveyance on, entering or adjacent to the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to exercise reasonable care for the protection of others."</p><h2>Is Removing Speed Limits Safe?</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTc0MzUy/ford-mustang-rtr-package_06.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Ford</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>According to a report cited by <em><a href="https://www.theautopian.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-germanys-autobahn-which-is-overrated/">The Autopian</a></em>, statistics show that most of Germany's roadway fatalities happen on rural roads and not major Autobahns, indicating that derestricted roadways may have a safety benefit. On the other hand, the <a href="https://etsc.eu/autobahn-speed-limit-would-save-140-lives/">European Transport Safety Council</a> did research showing that a speed limit would save 140 lives per year. Essentially, it comes down to how citizens use the derestricted roads. If everybody is doing 80 mph, there's little chance of a crash, but if somebody traveling at that speed (or higher) is driving an unroadworthy vehicle or otherwise behaving recklessly, the consequences could be dire - even on a long, straight piece of road like I-8. This bill is sure to spark debate, and we'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.</p> ]]>

Despite years of rumors that the Sonata would be quietly dropped, <a href="http://thekoreancarblog.com/next-gen-hyundai-sonata-dn9-development-confirmed/">reports out of Korea</a> say an all-new generation (internal code DN9) is in development for a late-2026 debut at home, with U.S. sales likely following as a 2027 model. <br><br>The twist is that Hyundai is said to be leaning into a more square, ’80s-inspired look that channels the first-generation 1985 Sonata, wrapped in the company’s new “Art of Steel” design language. In a lineup where crossovers like the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/why-the-2026-hyundai-palisade-didnt-get-americas-highest-safety-rating">Palisade</a> are now the headliners, the next Sonata is shaping up as a chance to reset the sedan with a very different visual pitch.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDMx/screenshot-2025-12-19-at-95326am.png" height="668" width="1200"> </figure> <h2><strong>Boxier, More ’80s, Less Four-Door Coupe</strong></h2><p>Current Sonatas lean on a low, fastback-style roofline and the “Sensuous Sportiness” surfacing Hyundai has pushed across its cars for years. DN9 is expected to move in the opposite direction. Early reporting and design briefings suggest a taller, more upright three-box profile with straighter lines, stronger shoulders and cleaner, structural-looking body sides. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/think/" rel="nofollow">Think</a> less swoopy coupe, more grown-up, slightly retro sedan that nods to the original Y1-era Sonata without turning into a full-on nostalgia exercise.<br><br>Hyundai’s Art of Steel language, previewed on other future products, is all about emphasizing the shape and tension of metal rather than hiding it under complex curves. Expect full-width LED light bars front and rear, crisp daytime running light signatures and big “SONATA” lettering on a simplified tail. That fits with Hyundai’s broader move toward bolder, more geometric designs, which already <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/hyundais-all-new-elexio-midsize-electric-suv-caught-on-camera-for-the-first-time">extends to its EVs</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDMy/screenshot-2025-12-19-at-95357am.png" height="665" width="1200"> </figure> <h2><strong>Hybrids First, Software Upgrades And A Cleaner Cabin</strong></h2><p>Under the skin, the next Sonata is widely expected to double down on electrification rather than shift to a full EV platform. Hybrid powertrains should form the core of the lineup, with a plug-in hybrid likely for markets that support it, building on the current car’s mix of 2.5-liter gas engines and hybrid options. Pure gas-only trims may be trimmed back or region-specific as emissions rules tighten.<br><br>Inside, Hyundai is said to be planning a more software-centric cabin with updated infotainment, a new operating system and more advanced driver-assistance features. The aim is to deliver a quieter, more premium-feeling sedan without chasing the kind of all-screen minimalism that some buyers now find cold. Lessons from bigger models, including how safety systems and crash structures are tuned in SUVs like the Palisade, will inevitably filter down to the midsize four-door as Hyundai seeks stronger ratings and a cleaner safety story next time around.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDM1/screenshot-2025-12-19-at-95414am.png" height="671" width="1200"> </figure> <h2><strong>Why Hyundai Still Cares About Sonata</strong></h2><p>The Sonata’s domestic importance is hard to overstate. It used to be Korea’s best-selling car and still carries a lot of brand weight, even if crossovers and larger sedans have now overtaken it on the sales charts. Globally, it also gives Hyundai a recognizable player against stalwarts like <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/toyota-camry-luggage-test" rel="nofollow">the Camry</a> and Accord, and dropping it outright would leave a gap beneath the electric Ioniq 6 that the market hasn’t clearly justified.<br><br>Instead, Hyundai appears ready to give the nameplate one more big swing: a more upright, retro-tinged sedan that plays the “future classic” card rather than trying to be a pseudo-coupe. For U.S. buyers, that will mean another option in a segment that still matters, especially for shoppers who don’t want an SUV and who might currently be gravitating toward <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/2026-hyundai-palisade-lease-deal-december">value plays</a> instead.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>If you've noticed the steering wheel in your <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/2025-bmw-x3-is-a-technological-extravaganza">BMW X3</a> moving without you touching it, you're not going crazy. According to a new recall submitted to the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25V857-8946.pdf">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, several thousand 2025 and 2026 <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/" rel="nofollow">BMW</a> X3 crossovers have a problem with their steering system software that could cause the wheels to move unintentionally. These vehicles were manufactured between August 14, 2024, and October 20, 2025, and the recall affects 36,922 vehicles, or 100% of that production run. Fortunately, it's a relatively simple fix, and so far, it hasn't caused any major issues that BMW is aware of.</p><h2>Which Models Are Affected and How They'll be Fixed</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDA4Mzcw/2026-bmw-x3.jpg" height="776" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>BMW</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>The NHTSA recall report says that both X3 30 xDrive and X3 M50 xDrive variants have the problem, which occurs if one or two of the channels within the steering torque sensor malfunctions while the vehicle is standing still (i.e., the car has just been started or has been put in drive but isn't yet moving). The report goes on to say that software diagnostics may not correctly detect the problem, and since these vehicles are steered with an electric motor to steer rather than a hydraulic rack, the fix is a simple one: update the steering system software via an over-the-air update. Alternatively, owners can visit a local dealer to have the bug removed at no charge.</p><p align="center"><strong><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmws-screw-that-no-one-else-can-turn">Related: BMW’s Screw That No One Else Can Turn</a></strong></p><p>Dealers are already aware, but BMW only intends to send owner notification letters out on February 2. That's not a big deal because, as mentioned, the issue has not caused any accidents or injuries that BMW is aware of. Still, it's worth addressing as soon as possible because, although BMW has only seen this problem appear while vehicles are stationary, "unexpected and unintended steering wheel movement may increase the risk of a crash and/or injury," says the NHTSA.</p><h2>BMW Has Had a Relatively Small Number of Recalls in 2025</h2><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDE3Mjc0/2026-bmw-x3-m50.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p>BMW</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>BMW has only had 20 recalls so far this year, but some of them have been serious. At the end of September, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/park-it-outside-bmw-issues-recall-after-cars-catch-fire-while-off">BMW warned owners to park outside</a> due to a fire risk affecting almost 200,000 vehicles, including the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/exploring-50-years-of-the-bmw-3-series">3 Series</a>, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/bmw-x3-generations-overview">X3</a>, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2022-bmw-4-series-review">4 Series</a>, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/carbuying/2025-bmw-x4-lease-deals-november">X4</a>, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2025-bmw-5-series-review">5 Series</a>, and the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmw-z4-final-edition-revealed-as-farewell-for-sporty-roadster">Z4</a>. With the Z4 impacted, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/toyota-announces-gr-supra-production-ending">Toyota GR Supra</a> was also affected. In October, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/bmw-recalls-1000-vehicles-for-faulty-seatbelts-that-may-fail-in-a-crash">BMW recalled smaller cars for faulty seatbelt retractors</a>, including the X1 and X2, and last month, the German automaker discovered that the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/recall-2000-2001-bmw-x5-exploding-takata-airbags">Takata airbag recall was still haunting it</a> because some owners may have retrofitted fancier but more deadly steering wheels. While some of these issues may be serious, BMW has had seven times fewer recalls this year than the worst offender, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a>, which has notched up <a href="https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/NHTSA-Recalls-by-Manufacturer/mu99-t4jn">145 recalls</a> thus far.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>RUF doesn’t build many full cars, and it builds even fewer like this. A 2012 RUF Rt 12 R, one of the wildest Porsche-based supercars of the 997 era, has come up for sale through Graham Rahal Performance and is being showcased on <a href="https://www.dupontregistry.com/autos/listing/2012/ruf/rt--12--r/537167"><em>duPont Registry</em></a> with an asking price of $899,995. <br><br>Finished in Candy Apple Red over a black interior and showing just 8,651 miles, it’s being described as one of only nine Rt 12 Rs built and the only one specified with “S Optics,” essentially blending the most extreme R mechanical package with S-style visual details.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDYx/2012-ruf-rt--12--r-899995-357962438.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 3 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/rare-730-hp-manual-ruf-porsche-based-supercar-for-sale-with-just-8651-miles">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>One Of Nine, And A Fully Fledged RUF</strong></h2><p>While it looks loosely like a 997-generation 911, the Rt 12 R is a full RUF-manufactured car, complete with its own VIN and extensive rework of the shell, running gear and engine. This example is from the final year of Rt 12 R production and is billed as the first fully in-house RUF motor car from that run. The body wears RUF’s own front bumper and splitter, wider rear haunches with integrated air tunnels to feed the turbos, and a carbon rear deck with a ducktail-and-wing combo that makes it look more like a road-legal GT racer than a tuned 911 Turbo.<br><br>Graham Rahal Performance’s car adds exposed carbon details around that rear spoiler and other trim pieces, plus center-lock wheels that sit just right in the arches. Inside, the cabin stays mostly in character for a 997, but you get RUF-specific seats, badging and carbon accents to remind you this isn’t a simple bolt-on job. For collectors who track provenance closely, the Rt 12 R sits in the same halo territory as other <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/jerry-seinfelds-ruf-modded-porsche-911s-is-hitting-the-auction-block">high-profile RUF builds</a>.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDY1/2012-ruf-rt--12--r-899995-680655826.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/rare-730-hp-manual-ruf-porsche-based-supercar-for-sale-with-just-8651-miles">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>730 HP, 6-Speed Manual And 200-Plus MPH</strong></h2><p>Under the rear deck is a heavily reworked twin-turbo flat-six, enlarged and strengthened with RUF internals. Figures for the R-spec Rt 12 hover around 730 horsepower and 693 pound-feet of torque, sent through a 6-speed manual gearbox and an all-wheel-drive system that can actually put that power down. Period testing quoted 0–60 mph in the low-three-second range and top speeds well north of 200 mph, with some sources suggesting geared-out potential close to 230 mph depending on final-drive choice.<br><br>To cope with that, RUF essentially rebuilt the car underneath, adding fixed coil-over suspension (with an optional front-axle lift), a hidden integrated roll cage, big brakes and sticky rubber. Curb weight lands around 3,300 pounds, which gives the Rt 12 R a power-to-weight ratio in genuine hypercar territory. As with earlier legends like the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-classic-porsche-based-supercar-is-expected-to-fetch-millions-at-monterey">RUF CTR “Yellowbird”</a>, the headlines aren’t just about the numbers, but about the way RUF blends raw speed with long-distance capability.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMDcw/2012-ruf-rt--12--r-899995-146028449.jpg" height="800" width="1199"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/rare-730-hp-manual-ruf-porsche-based-supercar-for-sale-with-just-8651-miles">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2><strong>RUF Values Keep Climbing</strong></h2><p>With an asking price just shy of $900,000, this Rt 12 R sits right at the sharp end of modern RUF values, but the wider market suggests there’s real appetite. More “mainstream” Rt 12s have already shown strong results, including a 650-horsepower, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/check-out-this-650-hp-1-of-13-ruf-rt12-up-for-auction-on-bring-a-trailer">1-of-13 Rt 12</a>. <br><br>Against that backdrop, a final-year Rt 12 R with unique specification, low mileage and dealer backing from Graham Rahal’s own performance outfit starts to make more sense as a flagship collectible.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A Huge Jump in Pricing</h2><p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/" rel="nofollow">Dodge</a> has opened the order books for the 2027 Charger Daytona Scat Pack, and the big story is a substantial price increase. The all-electric muscle coupe now starts at $72,495, with the four-door model priced slightly higher at $72,995. That’s a $9,810 jump over the 2026 model’s $62,685 starting price. </p><p>Despite the hike, Dodge continues to market the Daytona Scat Pack as the world’s most powerful muscle car, delivering 670 horsepower through its dual-motor electric powertrain.</p><p>Positioned at the top of the Charger lineup, the Daytona Scat Pack is a flagship for the brand’s electric ambitions. However, there's no notable performance or range enhancements for 2027, which is eyebrow-raising, to say the least. With <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/dodge-pulls-the-plug-after-the-electric-charger-daytona-r-t-failed-to-spark-sales">the base model gone</a>, Dodge is clearly evolving its strategy as it steers its muscle heritage into the EV era while keeping enthusiasts happy <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-cheapest-ice-powered-dodge-charger-officially-goes-on-sale">with gas-powered variants</a>. But will it resonate with customers?</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTU4/sixpack-powered-2026-dodge-charger-scat-pack.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Familiar Performance, Key Charging Upgrade</h2><p>Mechanically, the 2027 Daytona Scat Pack remains largely unchanged from 2026 model year. It retains its 400V all-wheel-drive setup, PowerShot feature that adds 40 horsepower on demand, and the signature Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust system that simulates a classic muscle-car soundtrack. Standard performance tools such as Launch Control, Drift Donut Mode, and multiple drive configurations all return unchanged.</p><p>The most significant update comes in charging capability. For 2027, Dodge equips all models with the North American Charging Standard (NACS) port and includes a J1772-to-NACS <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/best-bluetooth-car-adapters" rel="nofollow">adapter</a>. This gives owners access to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/" rel="nofollow">Tesla</a>’s Supercharger network, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/tesla-launches-v4-superchargers-faster-longer-more-accessible">vastly improving charging convenience and travel flexibility</a>. Dodge says retrofit details for 2026 models will be announced in early 2026.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTg2NDcw/dg026_124ch.jpg" height="595" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Why the Price Jumped</h2><p>While Stellantis didn't explain the hefty price hike, there are clues to consider. The entire EV market continues to face cost pressures. Prices for battery materials, semiconductors, and power electronics remain volatile, while automakers like Stellantis work to recoup massive investments in dedicated EV architectures. </p><p>Together, these factors could explain the near-$10,000 increase despite no performance bump. There's a chance Dodge might <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/dodge-slashes-12500-off-charger-daytona-ev">offer discounts throughout the Charger Daytona's life</a>, if you're really interested.</p><p>For interested buyers, some thinking needs to be done. The 2027 Charger Daytona Scat Pack adds meaningful charging convenience but no new speed or range gains. Perhaps the question you need to answer is whether you really want an electric muscle car.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwODkxNzE2/dodge-charger-daytona-scat-pack.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Stellantis</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-electric-dodge-charger-just-got-nearly-10000-more-expensive">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2><strong>A Rally-Inspired Spot Runs Afoul</strong></h2><p>It seems like the new <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2024-toyota-land-cruiser-reveal" rel="nofollow">Toyota Land Cruiser</a> FJ isn't the only <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/toyotas-new-land-cruiser-fj-already-banned-from-another-major-market">banned in the Land Down Under</a>. Toyota’s latest GR Yaris - or at least its TV ad – was designed as a celebration of one of the most character-rich hot hatches on sale today. The spot leans heavily into the GR Yaris’ rally heritage, opening with the car tearing across a remote landscape as its helmeted driver channels full World Rally Championship theatrics. </p><p>In a playful twist, the action pauses at a fictional drive-thru called “Up’n Down Burgers,” where a simple food order becomes the setup for a series of dramatic driving sequences, including gravel jumps, power slides, and water splashes. The result is a cinematic, tongue-in-cheek short film that exists squarely in fantasy rather than in daily driving reality.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGyx0-SzG64" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2><strong>Creativity Getting a Crutch</strong></h2><p>That sense of fun, however, is precisely what triggered a problem with Australian regulators. The commercial was banned from broadcast after being deemed non-compliant with the country’s motor vehicle advertising code. Authorities concluded that the driving behavior shown could be interpreted as unsafe or reckless if attempted on public roads, even though the ad clearly depicts a professional driver in controlled environments. </p><p>Following a complaint, the panel ruled that the visual messaging still crossed the line by normalizing maneuvers that would violate road laws, leading Toyota to withdraw the ad from television rotation in Australia.</p><p>While it is understandable that the video may <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/gen-z-drivers-continue-to-text-and-drive-despite-the-risks">cause harm impressionable teens</a>, for enthusiasts, the GR Yaris commercial hit all the right notes. Shot in the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/this-sick-subaru-brat-is-the-star-of-hoonigans-newest-gymkhana-film">same vein as those Hoonigan videos</a>, it embraced the idea that performance cars should be emotional and entertaining, not just practical appliances. Toyota’s GR division has built its reputation on authenticity and motorsport credibility, and this ad felt like an extension of that ethos. Rather than listing horsepower figures or acceleration times, it showed the car behaving like a rally weapon, exaggerating its capabilities in a way that made the GR Yaris feel alive and mischievous.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxMTA4/gr-yaris-banned-tv-ad---toyota-australia-02.png" height="800" width="1136"> <figcaption><p>Toyota Australia&sol;YouTube</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Times Have Changed, but Enthusiasm Remains</strong></h2><p>Regulators, however, tend to view such messaging through a very different lens. Advertising standards bodies increasingly prioritize the potential influence ads may have on general audiences rather than enthusiast intent. Even when scenes are clearly fictionalized, the concern is that aggressive driving imagery could encourage imitation. </p><p>Toyota has encountered similar issues in Australia before, including earlier GR Yaris commercials that were also pulled after drifting scenes drew complaints. The pattern suggests that performance-focused storytelling faces shrinking tolerance in tightly regulated markets.</p><p>While this latest ad may no longer appear on television, it continues to circulate online, where it has been enthusiastically received. For fans, the banned GR Yaris commercial has become something of a cult favorite, not just because of what it shows, but because it represents a shrinking space where <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/hyundai-veloster-banned">car advertising can be unapologetically fun</a>.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA5MTIyMjI3MTUzNTQ1MDYw/toyota-gr-yaris.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/banned-the-toyota-gr-yaris-ad-deemed-too-fun-for-tv">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

That should happen soon, but Toyota has confirmed that the loss of motive power could occur at high speed, an especially risky time for a vehicle to lose power. The fire risk is the other major potential risk if the issue isn’t remedied.</p><p>Toyota says that customers are expected to be notified by mid-February 2026 when information about a repair remedy is available.

<![CDATA[ <p>This E38 7-series-turned-rocket launcher is the perfect example of the old adage—desperate times call for desperate measures. What’s happening between Ukraine and Russia shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point. Both sides have been at it for quite a while, and they have significantly drained their available resources. Given the situation, the Ukrainian military had to get creative with their artillery, so this time they chose a Bavarian luxury sedan for frontline duties.</p><p>How good is the makeshift combat vehicle, you ask? At the back of this <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/e38-7-series-bmw-special-editions">vintage BMW 7-series</a> sits a Soviet-designed BM-21 Grad multiple launch rocket system (MLRS). Instead of fitting shopping bags, the trunk of this E38 is repurposed to fire three 122-mm rockets. The 7th Battalion, 114th Separate Brigade of Ukrainian Armed Forces transformed this <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/junkyard-gem-1998-bmw-740il">old E38 BMW</a> into what is essentially the ultimate fighting machine.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwODMy/bmw-e38-ukraine-1.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>X&sol;Osinttechnical</p></figcaption> </figure> <p>That’s not all. Being significantly lighter than a conventional 14-ton MLRS launch vehicle, this E38 can scamper along the battlefield like a stabbed rat. Of course, this does bring along disadvantages. For starters, it doesn’t have all the fancy armor (hence the lighter weight), so protection, should the worst happen, is virtually non-existent. But it does sport a grey-green paint job that allows it to blend in. Although camouflage is effective, it isn’t necessarily missile-proof, especially when the vehicle itself resembles an improvised <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/" rel="nofollow">BMW</a> with a massive rocket up its derriere.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ukrainian BMW 7 series MLRS firing a 122mm Grad rocket at a Russian target. <a href="https://t.co/0i9AQ9wq4Y">pic.twitter.com/0i9AQ9wq4Y</a></p>&mdash; OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) <a href="https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1999276652652539927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Also, you have to realize that launching a literal rocket from the back of a sedan comes with several logistical challenges. But the military has thought of this. They lay the tube flat along the roof while in transit, and once they reach the desired location, the BMW’s makeshift trunk-mounted MLRS deploys its wind-out legs to keep the car stable as the projectile is launched.</p><p>To their credit, the Ukrainian military has done a decent job, at least from what we can tell with the photos available. Then again, things aren’t as rosy as what we have at home, so if you’re living in that part of the world and somehow reading this—thank you, but more importantly, stay safe!</p> ]]>

It is one of the clearest signs yet of how hard Ford is yanking the wheel on its EV strategy as it pivots toward cheaper, smaller models and leans more heavily on hybrids.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTI1/lg-energy-solution-3081509372.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> </figure> <h2><strong>A Huge Battery Contract, Gone Overnight</strong></h2><p>The cancelled deal was inked in October 2024 and split into two long-term supply agreements. LG Energy Solution was due to build packs at its Polish plant, supplying tens of gigawatt-hours of capacity between the second half of this decade and the early 2030s. For LG, the order would have been a major anchor for European output and a way to lift utilisation at a factory that has not been running anywhere near full tilt.<br><br>Instead, Ford has told the supplier it is halting or scaling back some of the EV programs those packs were earmarked for. That lines up with a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-updates-plans-5-new-affordable-vehicles-by-2030">wider reset</a> already under way. As the mix changes, the math on a multi-billion-dollar dedicated LG order no longer adds up.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDEzNTA0/ai-image-of-new-electric-ford-fiesta.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>ChatGPT</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Ford Chases Cheaper EVs And A Leaner European Lineup</strong></h2><p>The battery cancellation also fits with Ford’s broader effort to get its European business back on track. The company has been hinting that familiar badges may come back in very different form, including the idea that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-ford-fiesta-may-be-coming-back-as-an-electric-car">the Ford Fiesta could return as an electric car</a>. Smaller, cheaper EVs need low-cost battery solutions, flexible sourcing and careful capital spending, not giant locked-in supply deals tied to a handful of specific models.<br><br>In Europe, Ford is also looking beyond its own walls for help. A <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-is-partnering-with-renault-to-revive-its-european-lineup">recently announced partnership</a> with Renault shows how serious it is about sharing platforms and powertrains to cut costs and fill gaps quickly. Stepping back from an enormous LG Energy Solution order gives Ford more room to reshape what batteries it buys, where they come from and which vehicles they support, instead of being locked into a fixed European EV cadence that no longer matches demand.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMTI2/lges-holland-internal-sign-770391401.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <h2><strong>Tough Hit For LG, Signal To The Battery Industry</strong></h2><p>For LG Energy Solution, losing a customer of Ford’s size on a contract this big is a real blow. The company now has to find new outlets for capacity it expected to have spoken for through at least the early 2030s, at a time when Western automakers are generally slowing EV rollouts and scrutinising every long-term commitment.<br><br>Ford, meanwhile, is betting that more flexible sourcing and a renewed focus on affordable EVs and hybrids will matter more than sticking to its original battery roadmap. The cost of that decision is now being felt in Seoul.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Made to Harness Solar Power</h2><p>Pickup beds are the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/nissans-newest-ev-doesnt-need-charging-but-will-it-reach-production">perfect real estate for solar panels</a>: flat, wide, and exposed to the elements. In fact, the idea of a solar-charging <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/best-truck-bed-covers" rel="nofollow">tonneau cover</a> has been floating around for years. Automakers have toyed with it – <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/" rel="nofollow">Tesla</a> even teased a solar tonneau for the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/tesla-cybertruck-first-look-interior-exterior-review" rel="nofollow">Cybertruck</a> before any hit the road.</p><p>So far, those factory-backed solutions haven’t come to fruition in meaningful volume. Instead, aftermarket companies have quietly been doing the actual work of turning truck beds <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/hyundai-santa-cruz-worksport-tonneau-cover">into power-generating surfaces</a>. Worksport is one of those companies, and its latest SOLIS solar tonneau cover brings that long-discussed concept to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/rivian/" rel="nofollow">Rivian</a> R1T owners. For a pickup that already leans heavily into outdoor use and off-grid capability, the addition feels like a logical extension rather than a novelty.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTk2/solis_rivianr1t_04-top_closed.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p>Worksport</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>What the SOLIS Cover Is and Where It Fits</h2><p>The Worksport SOLIS is a folding tonneau cover with integrated solar panels, designed to sit over the bed and generate power whenever the truck is parked. On the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-rivian-r1t-quad-motor-now-hits-60-in-2-6-seconds-and-its-quicker-than-a-911-gt3-rs">Rivian R1T</a>, the SOLIS puts out about 250 watts in full sun. Worksport had to tweak the design to fit trucks with or without the factory power tonneau, which required extra engineering compared to more typical pickups.</p><p>Worksport offers SOLIS compatibility for models from <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/" rel="nofollow">Chevrolet</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/gmc/" rel="nofollow">GMC</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ram/" rel="nofollow">Ram</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/nissan/" rel="nofollow">Nissan</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/" rel="nofollow">Jeep</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/" rel="nofollow">Dodge</a>, and now Rivian, covering much of the mainstream pickup market. Yes, it’s not a one-off experiment, but an accessory that mixes traditional truck hardware with clean-energy tech.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTk0/solis_rivianr1t_02-opening.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p>Worksport</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Charging, Power Output, and Real-World Use</h2><p>With 250 watts on tap, the SOLIS isn’t built to run big appliances or top up your EV’s main battery. It’s aimed at smaller, real-world usage. Pair it with Worksport’s COR portable battery, and you can store up the day’s solar power for when you actually need it. Under perfect sunlight, a single COR battery charges in about 4 hours.</p><p>Once charged, that power is enough for LED lights, phones, laptops, small fans, cameras, and basic tools. It’s the kind of setup that makes sense for camping, job sites, emergency backup, or light off-grid use – not running your whole house.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTk3/solis_rivianr1t_04-top_folded.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p>Worksport</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Direct EV Charging on the Horizon</h2><p>Worksport says <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/mercedes-benz-solar-paint-could-revolutionize-ev-charging">direct EV charging isn’t on the table yet</a>. They’re interested in working with automakers down the line to make that happen as electric pickups get more common. It’s the same promise Tesla made years back, but so far, nobody’s delivered.</p><p>Right now, you can order the SOLIS cover for the Rivian R1T via Worksport's <a href="https://www.worksport.com/products/solis?variant=43711290212412">website</a>, with first deliveries set for mid-January. The cover itself costs $1,999, not including the COR battery or the cables and mounting gear. Everything is modular, so you’re not locked into a permanent setup.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwOTk1/solis_rivianr1t_03-folded.jpg" height="800" width="1067"> <figcaption><p>Worksport</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 1 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/rivian-r1t-owners-can-now-use-solar-power">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Solving Smartphone Wireless Charging Issues</h2><p>Smartphones keep getting smarter, and wireless charging is now <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/wireless-charging-pads-are-a-must-have-for-new-car-buyers">something most of us expect</a>. Carmakers caught on, adding wireless charging pads to new models – usually right in front of the cupholders or under the center stack. On paper, it sounds like a win. But in the real world, the experience can be hit or miss. Phones don’t always stay put, charging slows down, and heat builds up, especially if you’re on the road for more than a quick errand.</p><p>That’s the challenge <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/nissan/" rel="nofollow">Nissan</a> set out to solve. Wireless charging – not the one <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/porsches-new-8000-wireless-charger-could-change-ev-ownership-forever">introduced by the electric Porsche Cayenne</a> – isn’t new, but making it work reliably in a moving car is another story. With the 2026 Murano and Pathfinder, Nissan is rolling out Qi2 wireless charging – the first time any automaker in the US has offered it. The goal: fix the alignment headaches and overheating problems that have made older in-car chargers more frustrating than helpful.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwODQ2/2026-nissan-pathfinder-_12_25-26-source.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Nissan</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>How Qi2 Changes the Experience</h2><p>The most obvious difference with Qi2 is physical. The charging pad uses a raised magnetic ring to lock compatible phones in place. Newer Google Pixels, iPhones from the 12 onward, and Android devices with supported cases can attach securely with this feature, keeping the phone aligned even when the vehicle goes over rough pavement.</p><p>That secure fit isn’t just for show because if your phone gets misaligned by just a bit, charging slows down fast. The magnets keep everything lined up, ensuring consistent power. Nissan also added a built-in cooling fan under the pad. By keeping temperatures down, the system can keep charging at full speed instead of cutting back when things get hot.</p><p>Charging speed gets a boost, too. Qi2 can deliver up to 15 watts – triple what many older in-car chargers manage. With the cooling fan working in the background, Nissan says you’ll see much faster top-ups from a low battery. There’s also an LED indicator that shows when your phone is charging or warns you if something’s blocking the pad.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwODQ0/2026-nissan-pathfinder-_12_25-25b-source.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Nissan</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/nissans-wireless-charger-fixes-a-problem-other-cars-havent">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2>Where You’ll Find It</h2><p>As mentioned, you’ll first see the Qi2 charger in two updated 2026 Nissans. The Murano gets it <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/reviews/i-drove-the-2026-nissan-murano-platinum-heres-my-review">as part of a bigger push for comfort and tech</a> in the midsize crossover space. The Pathfinder, which just got a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/2026-nissan-pathfinder-refresh-adds-sharper-design-and-smarter-tech">comprehensive refresh</a>, adds Qi2 to its list of smarter cabin features.</p><p>The 2026 Murano arrives with Qi2 as part of the lineup, and the Pathfinder with the new charger is set to hit dealerships early in 2026.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTYzMjIy/2026-nissan-murano.jpg" height="796" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Nissan</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 6 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/nissans-wireless-charger-fixes-a-problem-other-cars-havent">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Road and Track Toys</h2><p>For those who have high-octane fuel pumping in their veins, the most exciting vehicles out there are the performance supercars. These models are meant to handle daily life (sort of) while also posting incredible lap times on track days.</p><p>Arguably, the king of this segment is the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2023-porsche-911-gt3rs-reveal">Porsche 911 GT3 RS</a>, the barometer, the standard of which all other brands pattern their performance nameplates after. The newest challengers to the 911 GT3's crown are the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/chevy-built-a-corvette-zr1-that-shames-hypercars-costing-three-times-more">Chevrolet Corvette ZR1</a> and the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/ford-mustang-gtd-price-and-exclusive-details-leaked">Ford Mustang GTD</a>. These cars are built on the same ideals, so pitting them against each other is a given, and someone has just done that.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEKjBxlBQk4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>Three-Way Ultimate Lap Battle</h2><p>Hagerty's new video (see above) highlighted just how close these cars are in terms of performance. Each model has gone through the performance car initiation of posting a lap around the famed Nurburgring in Germany. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/corvette-zr1-and-zr1x-set-blistering-record-at-the-nurburgring">results of those 'Ring laps</a> showed that all three models were only 2.7 seconds apart, with the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/porsche/" rel="nofollow">Porsche</a> being the fastest around that track.</p><p>Hagerty pointed out that those lap times in Germany were recorded under different conditions and with different race car drivers, and that their test would eliminate any doubt by lapping all three cars under the same conditions and with the same race car driver, who, in this case, is Racing Hall of Famer Randy Pobst. The chosen track was the technical Sonoma Raceway, and the vehicles will use the tires they leave the dealership with.</p><p>Let's take a quick glance at the contenders, shall we? The Porsche 911 GT3 RS is a lightened and track-focused version of the 911 model that features a naturally aspirated flat-six that pumps out 518 horsepower and also has active aero goodies, namely the rear wing, which has a DRS mode to reduce drag on the straights. </p><p>America's sports car, the Corvette, now comes as a mid-ship menace, and the ZR1 is the meanest of them all with a twin-turbocharged V8 that generates a whopping 1,064 hp. Closing out the list is <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/" rel="nofollow">Ford</a>'s ultimate Mustang, the GTD, based on the GT3 race car and designed solely as a challenger to the GT3 RS. It has all the GT racing aero goodies, aided by a supercharged V8 producing a massive 815 hp.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwODY3/corvette-zr1-vs-mustang-gtd-vs-911-gt3-rs-record-breaking-lap-battle.png" height="465" width="1200"> </figure> <h2>Fair and Square</h2><p>Sonoma was chosen because it was technical and had the right mix of slow, fast, and long corners to give each car an equal fighting chance. <em>Hagerty </em>even showcased the track's major areas and how each car performed through them in a video.</p><p>In the end, America took the win, with the Corvette crossing the line and posting the fastest ever lap time by a production car around Sonoma at 1:34.941, with the Porsche clocking in a 1:37.286 (+2.345 seconds), and at last the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/best-ford-mustang-cars-of-all-time" rel="nofollow">Ford Mustang</a> GTD with a 1:38.710 (+3.769 seconds). </p><p>What is truly incredible is that the Corvette is actually the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/chevy-reveals-pricing-for-ultimate-zr1x-corvette-reveals-limited-special-edition">most affordable of the bunch</a>, and didn't have as much downforce. According to the video, the sheer power it produced, along with the amazing balance, kept it in the lead throughout the whole lap.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwODY4/corvette-zr1-vs-mustang-gtd-vs-911-gt3-rs-record-breaking-lap-battle.png" height="502" width="1200"> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/watch-the-corvette-zr1-beat-the-mustang-gtd-and-porsche-911-gt3-rs-at-sonoma">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Do or Die for Jaguar</h2><p>It's been over a year since <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/jaguar-reveals-its-future-with-polarizing-type-00">Jaguar faced a flurry of online abuse</a> with its "Copy Nothing" campaign. It was supposed to be a reimagining of the British marque, but it became tabloid fodder in record time. Armchair pundits wasted no time blaming that for <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jaguar/" rel="nofollow">Jaguar</a>'s sales collapse this year, too.</p><p>But whatever your opinion on the whole matter is, here's the truth: The reason for the company effectively having no sales this year is that it went on hiatus in 2025. It was to regroup before the launch of its first all-new model under the rebrand. You can't have sales if you have nothing to sell in the first place.</p><p>Why did the brand do such a polarizing move? As good as the traditional models were, they simply weren't selling. Many cried foul, but the products weren't bringing in the money. Now, it's time for Jaguar to prove to the world that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/jaguars-wild-rebrand-the-internets-collective-meltdown-has-missed-the-point">reinvention was the only way forward</a>. With that, select British press have driven the new Jaguar (JaGUar?), and you may (or may not) like the first impressions.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExODU5MDU5MjMyNDgyODUx/jaguar-type-00-concept.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Jaguar</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>So, What's it Called?</h2><p>We're half-tempted to call it the XJ. After all, the car is a low-slung four-door that measures over 210 inches, so one can say it's patterned after Jaguar's old traditional flagship sedan. That said, it doesn't have a name yet, and given the brand's stance on moving away from tradition, it might not be called XJ.</p><p>The British press has dubbed it simply as the GT. The name makes sense as Jaguar is pitching it as such. We'd choose that over Type 00, if we're being honest. We'll know more once the car is released, likely in mid to late 2026.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMDY4/1953.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Jaguar</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>They've Seen It, But We'll Have to Wait a Little Longer</h2><p>The British press said they've seen the car sans its camouflage wrap. For now, we'll have to take their word for it that it looks far better than they expected. That's what The Independent said about the GT, with the words "striking" and "stunning" among the adjectives used to describe it. <em>Evo</em> used the same words, adding that it's still closely related to the polarizing Type 00. <em>Evo</em> also mentioned that the car was no longer pink.</p><p>Other interesting details? <em><a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/jaguar/368552/new-jaguar-gt-2025-ride-review-pictures">Auto Express</a></em> said the car has frameless doors to give it the classic four-door hardtop look. Despite the rakish profile, occupants apparently get a commanding driving position. Autocar noted the interior was still draped in covers, but saw glimpses of light-colored trim and a steering wheel that was 'very reminiscent' of the concept.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMDY5/1956.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Jaguar</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Riding Impressions</h2><p>Now, those invited to see the car were allowed behind the wheel. Instead, it was JLR’s Vehicle Engineer Director who took members of the media around the company's testing facility in Gaydon.</p><p>Noteworthy observations? Several pointed out linear acceleration instead of explosive off-the-line performance. "We’ve gone for a linear power delivery rather than one that gets you to 70-80 mph as quickly as possible, and then the acceleration drops off a cliff," Becker told Evo. The ride was rated as pliant at lower speeds and planted at 150 mph. Meanwhile, refinement and isolation were "eerie,<em>" as Autocar </em>described. The common consensus? A promising product.</p><p>As for technical details, it's still limited at the time of writing. What is confirmed is a tri-motor arrangement that puts out close to 1,000 hp combined. It uses a skateboard platform, so it seems unlikely it will ever <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/jaguar-designed-a-new-xj-and-then-canceled-it-at-the-last-minute">come with an engine</a>. Adaptive air suspension and torque vectoring are fitted.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMDcw/1954.jpg" height="675" width="1200"> </figure> <section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwMDY2/1957.jpg" height="676" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Jaguar</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/jaguars-first-new-car-after-its-rebrand-is-nothing-like-you-expect">original article</a> </em> </div> </section> ]]>

<![CDATA[ In 1978, BMW introduced the M1, a supercar often regarded as the origin story of the brand’s M-series cars. However, unlike the M2s, M3s, M4s, M5s, and other miscellaneous M-sport cars pushed by today’s BMW dealers, just 456 road-going M1s were ever built and sold to customers as homologation ... ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>A special car from a special racing series</h2><p>In 1978, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/" rel="nofollow">BMW</a> introduced the M1, a supercar often regarded as the origin story of the brand’s M-series cars. However, unlike the M2s, M3s, M4s, M5s, and other miscellaneous M-sport cars pushed by today’s BMW dealers, just 456 road-going M1s were ever built and sold to customers as homologation specials.</p><p>Originally, BMW developed the mid-engined M1 supercar as a means to compete in the Group 4 and Group 5 categories of sports car racing. However, when homologation rule changes threatened to derail these plans, BMW Motorsport chief Jochen Neerpasch came up with a show that became one of motorsport’s most memorable spectacles. The result was the BMW M1 Procar series, a single-make championship featuring identical M1 race cars driven by Formula 1 stars competing directly against drivers from the World Sportscar Championship, European Touring Car Championship, and other international series. </p><p>These races served as support events during European F1 Grand Prix weekends in 1979 and 1980, bringing massive exposure and star power to the otherwise niche series. This kind of exposure, in essence, killed two birds with one stone: it showcased BMW’s new supercar on a grand stage, while giving BMW time to work out its homologation requirements. </p><p>The most notable part of this series was that Neerpasch got Formula One’s governing body and team principals on board to lend F1’s biggest names. This meant that legends like Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet, Alan Jones, and Clay Regazzoni delivered intense wheel-to-wheel action before the stars went on to tear up the racetrack in their F1 cars on race weekends.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwNjg3/940404.jpg" height="679" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Mecum Auctions</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/niki-laudas-special-bmw-m1-is-hitting-the-auction-block">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><h2>The champion's M1</h2><p>This special BMW M1, <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/1157621/1980-bmw-m1/">headed to the auction block at Mecum’s Kissimmee auction</a> on January 17, 2026, has an incredible provenance, as it was the "trophy car" awarded to none other than Niki Lauda, the winner of the inaugural BMW M1 Procar Championship in 1979.</p><p>Finished in bright white, this BMW features some special Procar-themed touches that inherently reflect the era and the racing series that gave birth to this car. This M1 features hand-painted BMW M tri-color stripes signed by the renowned Walter Maurer, the German artist known for his participation in the BMW Art Car series.</p><p>In addition, Lauda's M1 also sports some Procar-style touches that reflect the very vehicle he took to victory on the streets of Monaco and the curves and corners of Silverstone and Monza, including a special Procar-style front bumper sporting a proper-sized air dam, rear louvers over the rear glass, and a white, staggered set of 16-inch Campagnolo wheels that match the body.</p><section> <figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIwNjg4/848695.jpg" height="679" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Mecum Auctions</p></figcaption> </figure> <div> <em> View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/niki-laudas-special-bmw-m1-is-hitting-the-auction-block">original article</a> </em> </div> </section><p>Under the hood is a road-going version of the 3.5L M88/1 inline-six engine developed by BMW Motorsport for this car. It features a Bosch Motronic fuel injection system, individual throttle bodies, and a Magneti-Marelli ignition system. The engine produced a whopping 266 HP and 243 lb-ft of torque, all of which was transmitted through a ZF 5-speed manual transmission, reaching a purported top speed of 165 mph. </p><p>Though the supercar is styled as a replica of a true racecar, BMW's luxurious side sticks out in the M1's interior. Lauda's ride features a cabin upholstered entirely in blue leather, as well as a smattering of period-correct luxury features, including power windows, air conditioning, and a Becker Europa stereo.</p><p>According to the listing, this M1 was imported to the United States in 1987 and was shown at the 2017 Hillsborough Concours d'Elegance in California. Additionally, it has 20,350 kilometers (~12,650 miles) on the clock and a highly detailed undercarriage.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Mecum says the Lauda BMW M1 will cross the auction block on Saturday, January 17th, at the Kissimmee auction and is estimated to fetch between $625,000 and $675,000.</p><p>Given this car's provenance and the incredible backstory behind its existence, this is not only an opportunity to own a relic of a Formula 1 legend but also part of a larger story that cemented a brand beloved by enthusiasts all over the world. After all, Niki had to <em>earn</em> this BMW M1 by showcasing the kind of racing that earned him three world championships in a vehicle different from the F1 machines that cemented his legacy.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2>Big in America, Not So in Japan</h2><p>Calling <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/toyota-camry-luggage-test" rel="nofollow">the Camry</a> a hit in the US would be a massive understatement. It was instrumental in making <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/" rel="nofollow">Toyota</a> an even bigger household name, and it remains, by far, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/2025-toyota-camry-review">America's favorite midsize sedan</a>. It's a totally different story in Japan, though.</p><p>In its home market, it's not exactly a spectacular seller. Sales of the previous-generation Camry weren't particularly great in Japan, leading to its discontinuation two years ago. At the same time, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/features/toyota-crown-suv-crossover-sedan-wagon">the Crown has been a longtime staple over there</a>, and more buyers opted for that or stuck with the Corolla. The current model isn't offered in Japan anymore, but it will be until next year.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTE0NzA0/2025-toyota-camry-xle.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Staging a Comeback For Appeasement</h2><p>Now, the company has confirmed that the Camry will be back in Japanese showrooms in 2026. The Japan-market Camrys will be sourced from Toyota's Georgetown, Kentucky plant, as the company does not have production allocation in its own backyard. </p><p>Now, the reason it's coming back to Japan isn't because of demand <em>per se</em>. Remember, Toyota stopped selling it in its home turf in 2023. Instead, it's the company's move to soften the blow of trade deficits and appease the current administration. The Camry will be one of three American-made Toyotas sold in Japan. The other two are the Highlander and, of all things, the Tundra...in the land of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/kei-car/" rel="nofollow">kei car</a>.</p><p>The Highlander was actually sold in Japan at one point as the Kluger. It lasted just one generation from 2001 to 2007 and Toyota has not offered a similar vehicle there since then. The JDM-spec Highlanders will be sourced from the company's plant in Princeton, Indiana. As for the Tundra, it's never been officially for sale there.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTE0NzAy/2025-toyota-camry-xle.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>Potential Challenges</h2><p>On paper, it sounds like a good plan to boost production in the US, but there's also the matter of logistics and the profitability of these cars once they reach Japanese showrooms. For starters, shipping from America to Japan won't be cheap, and American labor costs could also drive up the price.</p><p>Building these vehicles for Japanese specifications will be a factor, too. The plant has to accommodate production for right-hand drive, and some adjustments have to be made to suit the regulations abroad. That said, the Highlander might have it a little easier as the Indiana plant already makes a version for Australia which is also right-hand drive and have been doing so since 2003.</p><p>From a logical standpoint, it would be more cost-effective and logistically efficient to import the Camry from nearby Thailand or China if Japan really wanted the Camry back. The same goes for the Highlander, which is also manufactured over in China. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/business/automobiles/toyota-to-import-3-us-made-models-into-japan-from-2026"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a> pointed out that the success of this plan will depend on Japan's transport ministry's willingness to simplify the approval process for imported vehicles.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAxMDIxNjY3/2021-toyota-kluger-range-l-r-gx-petrol-grande-hybrid-gxl-hybrid.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>ToyotaT</p></figcaption> </figure> <h2>"Reverse Importing" From the US Isn't New</h2><p>The whole concept of a Japanese car made in America, then being sold in Japan, isn't new. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/" rel="nofollow">Honda</a> did that in the late '80s and through the mid-'90s with the Accord. The coupe and wagon were built in Ohio. Interestingly, the parts came from Japan, were assembled in the US, and then returned to Japan.</p><p>Speaking of which, Honda is also considering doing that all over again. Like Toyota, it's for appeasement. We previously reported that the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/honda-may-send-american-built-suvs-back-to-japan">Pilot and Ridgeline are likely candidates to be exported from Alabama</a>. That said, Honda isn't exactly shy about the fact that some of its <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/news/the-jdm-plot-twist-japan-is-now-importing-its-own-hondas">JDM models are made elsewhere</a>. For instance, the Japanese-market Accord and CR-V are sourced from Thailand, the Odyssey hails from China, and the WR-V mini-SUV is shipped from India.</p><figure> <img src="https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/NzowMDAwMDAwMDAwOTI4Mzcx/2025-toyota-camry.jpg" height="800" width="1200"> <figcaption><p>Toyota</p></figcaption> </figure> ]]>
