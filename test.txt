<p class="has-text-align-none">Samsung’s latest SmartThings update adds support for Siri Shortcuts. In a press release, Samsung announced that you can now use Siri to run SmartThings routines, allowing you to use Apple’s voice assistant to control your smart home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Siri Shortcuts is a feature in iOS that lets you run automations by asking Siri. These can either be created by the user in the Shortcuts app or by the manufacturers in their app.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This update should make it easier to control your SmartThings home using your iPhone, HomePod, or other Apple device. For example, you can now call on Siri to trigger your “Good morning” routine through SmartThings that automatically adjusts the lights, turns on your coffee maker, and opens your blinds when you wake up. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Samsung is also enhancing its SmartThings app for Apple devices. On the Apple Watch, you can now see a full list of your devices, send commands, and carry out routines, while the SmartThings app for iOS gives you the ability to view and control up to five of your most recently used devices from your lock screen with Live Activities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Black Friday is the most anticipated day of the year for bargain hunters. While there’s still some time to go before November 28th, we’re already starting to see a selection of early discounts, allowing you to get a jump on your holiday shopping. Right now, for instance, you can get nearly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/813053/fitbit-fitness-tracker-deals-black-friday-sale-2025">50 percent off select Fitbits</a>, while Apple’s latest 13-inch MacBook Air — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">our pick for the best laptop</a> — is down to an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/?th=1">all-time low of $749.99</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, that’s just a taste of what’s to come in November. As the month goes on, we’re expecting to see even more deals — including sizable drops on robovacs, TVs, and headphones. In fact, retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have already shared when we can expect their latest sales. We’ll be updating this guide over the next several weeks, too, so be sure to check back as we approach the main event.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Paramount Plus is going up in price again. As part of its <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/static-files/53c82d68-0e50-45cf-a8b9-3023c5ce9cc7">earnings report released</a> on Monday, Paramount announced that it will raise prices for subscribers in the US on January 15th, 2026, bringing the ad-supported Essential plan from $7.99 to $8.99 per month, while the ad-free Premium plan will go from $12.99 to $13.99 per month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Paramount says the price increase will “fuel continued reinvestment in the user experience and deliver an even stronger slate of programming” going forward. Like many other streamers, Paramount has hiked the price of its streaming service on an almost yearly basis. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23733505/paramount-plus-showtime-price-increase">Paramount Plus raised prices</a> in 2023 before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23775370/paramount-plus-price-increase-showtime">hiking them further last June</a>. It also recently raised prices in Canada and Australia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The price change comes just months after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv/756298/paramount-plus-skydance-merger-complete-david-ellison">Paramount completed its deal to merge</a> with Skydance, kicking off some big shifts at the company, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/802428/paramount-skydance-is-preparing-to-layoff-about-2000-us-employees">mass layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/792752/cbs-news-paramount-the-free-press-acquisition-bari-weiss">the appointment</a> of <em>The Free Press</em> founder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/793525/bari-weiss-cbs-news-glass-cliff">Bari Weiss as the head of CBS News</a>. Paramount has also announced that it will require employees to return to the office full-time, five days a week, starting in January.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During Skydance’s first few months of ownership, Paramount Plus added 1.4 million subscribers, bringing its total to 79.1 million. Paramount <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757341/paramount-plus-ufc-deal-sports-streaming">struck a $7.7 billion deal</a> that will bring live UFC fights to its streaming service as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along with price hikes, Paramount revealed that it’s “retiring” free trials for its streaming service and “reviewing discount practices.” The company also plans to update the technology stack behind Paramount Plus and its free, ad-supported streaming service Pluto TV to enhance their performance, and is looking into how it can use AI to offer better personalization and recommendations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo rarely offers big discounts on its own games and gear throughout the year, but opportunities to save are coming soon. The company <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-announces-holiday-offers-for-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2025/">announced</a> that multiple retailers will offer discounts of up to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/">$30 off of beloved Switch games</a>, as well as temporary price cuts on its amiibo figures, and a $20 off discount on microSD Express cards that are only compatible with the Switch 2.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These discounts begin at slightly different times. If you’re shopping for games digitally through your Switch or Switch 2, you can get the jump on deals in Nintendo’s Cyber Deals sale starting November 20th and lasting through December 3rd at 11:59 PM PT.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, Nintendo and select retailers will offer deals on physical versions of first-gen Switch games beginning November 23rd. First-party titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a></em> will be available for $39.99 each ($20 off). You can also save on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch/"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, each of which will be available for $29.99 ($30 off).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, there are no deals on Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive titles; however, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em> all offer a downloadable Switch 2 update for free with purchase. Those updates generally provide smoother gameplay at higher resolutions on the newer handheld.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re into collecting amiibo, Nintendo will also offer discounts on select models, including Tulin, Yunobo, and Ruji from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, along with <em>Street Fighter 6</em> figures of Jamie, Kimberly, and Luke. Finally, starting November 30th, Nintendo stores in New York and San Francisco, along with select retail stores, will offer $20 off Samsung microSD Express cards, so presumably, you’ll be able to get the $59.99 256GB for $39.99.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">With a smart video doorbell, your front door’s communication skills go from 1980s landline to a modern smartphone. Combining a motion-activated camera with a microphone, speaker, and buzzer, a doorbell camera sends alerts to your phone, allowing you to see who’s at the door without needing to open it or even be at home. Whether you’re curled up on the couch, hard at work in your office, or sunning on a beach in the Bahamas, a video doorbell keeps you in touch with what’s happening on your doorstep.</p>

<p>I’ve tested dozens of video doorbells, and while there’s no one-size-fits-all, like a smartphone, it’s a personal choice, I have <em>thoughts</em> on which are the best of the best and which work well for specific use cases.</p>

<p>My top advice is to use the existing doorbell wires if you have them. Wired doorbells are generally cheaper, work better, and are more compact, so they tend to look nicer.</p>

<p>If you don’t have wires and don’t want to pay for an electrician to run them, try using an AC power adapter (<a href="https://ring.com/products/video-doorbell-plugin-adapter-gen-2">Ring</a> and <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/ninety7_indoor_power_adapter_nest_hello?hl=en-US">Google Nest</a> sell their own; you can also find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doorbell-Transformer-800mA-Adapter-Compatible/dp/B07PJHVJ2T">generic ones</a>).&nbsp;But if all else fails, I’ve got recommendations for good battery-powered buzzers. Just plan to pick up an extra battery when you purchase, or factor in removing it from your door every few months to charge it for a few hours.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="B042YE">Best doorbell camera</h2>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Nest Doorbell (wired, first generation)</h3>
<div class="product-description">With 24/7 recording, facial recognition, reliable smart alerts, and some free video recording, Google’s wired doorbell is the best option for most people. </div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24100829/226345_Nest_Doorbell_wired_JTuphy_0006.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="A picture of a Google Nest doorbell camera." /></figure>
<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_doorbell"> $179.99 at <strong>Google</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-nest-doorbell-wired-3rd-gen-latest-model-2k-video-and-gemini-hazel/J39TC8J8W5"> $179.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Google-Nest-Doorbell-Wired-2nd-Gen-Linen-GA03695-US/322549632"> $179.99 at <strong>The Home Depot</strong></a></li></ul></div>
<p><em><em><strong>Video quality:</strong>&nbsp;960 x 1280p, 6x zoom, HDR /&nbsp;<strong>Smart alerts: </strong>Person, package, animal, vehicle, and facial recognition ($) <strong>Aspect ratio:</strong>&nbsp;3:4 /&nbsp;<strong>Field of view:</strong>&nbsp;145 degrees diagonal /&nbsp;<strong>Power options:</strong>&nbsp;Wired /&nbsp;<strong>Wi-Fi:</strong>&nbsp;2.4GHz and 5GHz /&nbsp;<strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;Cloud and local /&nbsp;<strong>Subscription fee:</strong>&nbsp;$10 a month&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Works with:</strong>&nbsp;Alexa, Google, SmartThings</em></em></p>

<p>The Nest Doorbell Wired (2nd-gen) can record 24/7, and scrolling through a continuous timeline view of everything that’s happened at your front door can be very helpful if you don’t want to miss anything. This, along with a good price, great video quality, the ability to tell you what <em>and</em> who is at your door, and some free recorded clips, make it the best doorbell for most people.</p>

<p>The Nest Wired is also the best video doorbell that works with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23744291/google-smart-home-nest-how-to">Google Home</a>, and the best for protecting your packages. Its proactive package watch feature tells you when a package arrives and sends another alert when it’s gone. In my testing, it worked very well.</p>

<p>Unlike many competitors — such as Ring and Arlo — Google doesn’t charge for smart notifications. The Nest Wired will tell you if it’s a person, package, animal, or vehicle at your door for free. You also get free activity zones to cut down on unwanted notifications, and three free hours of event-based recordings, thanks to local storage and local processing.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>You can, in theory, use this doorbell without paying a subscription</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>But three hours isn’t enough to be particularly useful, and to get recorded video, you need a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home_premium?hl=en-US">Google Home Premium subscription</a> (starting at $10 per month, $100 per year). This does cover all your Google Nest cameras, though, and it adds Nest’s excellent Familiar Faces feature, which tells you who is at your door, plus new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789412/new-nest-cams-nest-doorbell-launch-price-specs-release-date">Gemini for Home features.</a></p>

<p>If you want 24/7 recording, you need Google Home Premium Advanced ($20 per month, $200 a year), but again, this subscription applies to all Google Nest cameras you have.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24100827/226345_Nest_Doorbell_wired_JTuphy_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Close-up of the button at the bottom of the Nest doorbell" title="Close-up of the button at the bottom of the Nest doorbell" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Nest wired has four color options and more discreet branding than most doorbells.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge" data-portal-copyright="Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge" />
<p>On paper, the Nest doesn’t have the best specs; the second-generation <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Pro-2/dp/B086Q54K53">Ring Wired Pro</a> is technically better. But it does deliver a 960 x 1280 pixel resolution with a 6x digital zoom, and video quality is very good, thanks to some digital trickery. Its 3:4 portrait aspect ratio and 145-degree field of view are very good, and I could see my porch from top to bottom and a fair amount from side to side.</p>

<p>On-device AI makes the Nest speedy with notifications, and it delivers rich alerts to both your phone and watch. These are interactive, allowing you to press and hold the video to see a clip and activate one of the three preset quick responses. It’s also quick to call up live video.</p>

<p>Nest’s doorbells and cameras work with Nest and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058471/google-nest-camera-work-with-amazon-alexa-echo-speakers">Amazon Alexa smart displays</a> for viewing a live feed. Google also now lets you have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24252165/google-smart-home-panel-comes-to-all-google-tvs">a live stream pull up automatically on your Google TV</a> when someone rings the doorbell — a super handy feature.</p>

<p>There are a few quirks. There’s no reliable way to snooze notifications from the doorbell, and if you use multiple Nest speakers or displays, they’ll <em>all</em> announce your visitors. Not great if you have a Nest Mini in your kid’s nursery.</p>

<p>Google <span>recently launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24213639/google-gemini-intelligence-ai-google-home-nest-aware" target="_blank">search and description feature</a>&nbsp;for its c</span>ameras as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762370/google-announces-gemini-for-home-nest-smart-speakers-voice-assistant">Gemini for Home</a>, its new AI-powered smart home features. This will send an alert describing exactly what’s happening in a clip, providing more context before opening the app. You’ll also be able to search through footage for specific events — like kids on bikes. We’re starting to test this now; it requires a Google Home Premium subscription.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="UsccYZ">Best battery-powered doorbell camera</h2>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Ring Battery Doorbell Plus</h3>
<div class="product-description">This is a great battery-powered buzzer with excellent video quality, a good head-to-toe view, and very speedy response times for a battery doorbell. It integrates well with Amazon Alexa and can record locally to a Ring Alarm Pro, but the battery only lasts about two months unless you turn on battery-saving features.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24643836/236648_Ring_Battery_Doorbell_Plus_JTuohy_0012.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<p>If you really want a battery-powered buzzer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23628773/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-specs-release-date-features">the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus</a> is the way to go. It’s cheaper than the Ring Battery Pro, while still offering a head-to-toe view and high-quality video resolution to provide a clear picture of what’s happening at your door.</p>

<p>Unlike the $100 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24223639/ring-battery-doorbell-camera-price-release-date-specs">Ring Battery Doorbell</a>, the Plus uses removable, rechargeable batteries, making it easier to keep your doorbell charged. Just have a <a href="https://ring.com/products/quick-release-battery-pack">second on hand</a>, charged and ready to swap in when you get low. Most other doorbells require you to take them down to recharge.</p>

<p>The Plus also has color night vision and was more responsive than any other non-Ring battery doorbell I’ve tested. It pulled up a live view in under four seconds, compared with upwards of 10 seconds for most others.</p>

<p>As with other battery-powered doorbells, there’s no preroll. If catching people as they approach your door — not just <em>at</em> your door — is crucial, consider the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24063837/ring-battery-doorbell-pro-price-release-date-specs-features">Battery Doorbell Pro ($229.99)</a>. That model adds preroll and improved motion detection using radar, which significantly cuts down on nuisance alerts.</p>

<p>It’s only really worth spending the extra $80 if you have lots of trees or passing cars in front of your door and/or you want to make sure you see the whole event when someone approaches your door. The Pro is also compatible with 5GHz Wi-Fi, which could mean faster responses if your front door is close enough to your router. The Plus is 2.4GHz only.</p>

<p>Battery life isn’t great on either doorbell. They last around two months with all the features turned on except for extra-long recordings (the default is 30 seconds, but it can go up to 120). You can tweak settings to reduce power consumption, but then you have to give up features like HDR (which makes it easier to see faces) and snapshot capture, which takes a picture every five minutes to give you a better idea of what’s been happening at your door.</p>

<p>As with all Ring doorbells, there are no animal or vehicle alerts, only people and packages. These require a <a href="https://ring.com/protect-plans?">Ring Home plan starting at $4.99 a month,</a> or $49.99 per year, which also includes 180 days of recorded video.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265564/ring-ai-smart-video-search-security-camera-price-availability">AI-powered search feature</a> introduced in 2024 lets you search recorded footage for things like animals, vehicles, and even the color of the coat you wore when you left the house. It’s handy for understanding what’s been going on around your home, but you still can’t get an alert when your cat is sitting on your porch.</p>

<p>Other free features include pre-recorded quick replies, the option to set a motion alert schedule, live view, and two-way audio. The Plus can announce visitors on Echo speakers and automatically initiate a two-way audio/video call on an Echo Show. It won’t work with your existing chime unless you wire it (which also trickle-charges the battery), but Ring sells a plug-in chime.</p>

<p>The Plus also works with&nbsp;<a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054769672-Store-and-Process-Videos-Locally-with-Ring-Edge-and-Your-Ring-Alarm-Pro">Ring Edge, a local storage and processing option</a>&nbsp;that requires a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa">Ring Alarm Pro</a>&nbsp;smart hub and a Ring Home Premium subscription ($20 a month, $200 per year). This adds cellular backup through its built-in Eero Wifi system, so it can keep your doorbell online if both the power and internet go out.</p>

<p>The first-generation Blink Video Doorbell is the best cheap doorbell with a no-subscription option. And while it works as a wired doorbell, it’s also a good option for a battery-powered buzzer, as it can go up to&nbsp;two years&nbsp;on two AAs. I don’t&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;this doorbell, as video and audio quality are not great, but it’s cheap, it gets the job done, and that battery life is phenomenal.</p>

<p>The Blink doesn’t have smart alerts or quick replies, and it only records 1080p video at a standard 16:9 aspect ratio). But the basics are here: motion-activated recording (with a max of 30 seconds), alerts, live view (with caveats), night vision, motion zones, and two-way audio.</p>

<p>If you want to pay $50 (often less) to have a camera at your door and be done with it, get the Blink.&nbsp;Cloud storage is also a bargain at $3 a month ($30 a year), or you can do local storage with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ">the Sync Module 2</a>&nbsp;and a USB stick. You need the Sync Module to initiate a live view through the camera in the app (or you have to pay for the subscription). Without it, you can only see video if there’s a motion event or someone rings the doorbell.</p>

<p>The Sync Module is sold with the doorbell as a “doorbell system” for $70, and should pay for itself compared to a monthly subscription.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>Uniquely for a battery-powered doorbell, the Blink can&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>be a true hardwired doorbell</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The biggest selling point for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704290/amazon-blink-ring-camera-doorbell-brands-smart-home-why">Blink</a>&nbsp;is the feature that makes its similarly inexpensive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/__vg1021awD__22718595__________________https://voxmedia.stories./https://electronics.woot.com/offers/blink-outdoor-3rd-gen-17">security cameras</a>&nbsp;so attractive: up to two years of battery life on two AA lithium batteries. The company has developed a super energy-efficient chip that will power its cameras longer than any other doorbell I’ve tested. (I managed almost a year with&nbsp;<a href="https://support.blinkforhome.com/en_US/f-a-q/how-long-do-the-indoor-and-xt-camera-batteries-last">very heavy use</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uniquely for a battery-powered doorbell, the Blink can&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>be a true hardwired doorbell. When wired, it will activate an existing chime (something neither the&nbsp;<a href="https://ring.com/products/video-doorbell-wired">sub-$100 Ring</a>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915876/wyze-video-doorbell-pro-review-budget-doorbell-camera">Wyze</a>&nbsp;doorbells can do) and provide constant power — not just trickle charge. This means it can wake up faster than a battery-powered buzzer and catch your visitor as they arrive. Wiring also adds on-demand two-way audio and live view (otherwise, you can only see the stream if there’s a motion event at the doorbell or someone presses the buzzer.)</p>

<p>The Blink comes in white or black and, because it uses just two AA batteries, isn’t as huge as most battery-powered doorbells, making it a more discreet option. However, it is a giant pain in the neck to install; make sure to follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.youtube.com_watch-3Fv-3D3xSHRiE-5F7-2D4&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;r=HTakECkqD13F_4No8TePr7snOg-TM_Z0bAqwspVK1Ig&amp;m=F3bVs1RDQQjltruLowQMEQzX4QXTLqh2wnlOdE-QbIo&amp;s=A4uRxuj7wvLBZ-eKFSExudfv4iq7rR51t86iV8AKi_8&amp;e=">video instructions</a>&nbsp;Blink provides closely to save a lot of frustration.</p>

<p>The biggest drawbacks are lower video quality and poor audio quality (it can be staticky, and it’s push-to-talk — not full duplex), short recording length, and no smart alerts. The app is also a bit tricky to navigate. It doesn’t work with Google Home, but it works great with Alexa, and you can see a live view on Echo Show devices and use any Echo speaker as an indoor chime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Note: Blink recently launched a second-generation video doorbell with higher image resolution, a head-to-toe view, and person detection for the same price. I plan to test this soon. You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676241/blink-launches-second-gen-video-doorbell-with-person-detection">read more details here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="zVdu3s">Best doorbell camera without a subscription</h2>
<div class="product-block"><h3>TP-Link Tapo D225 Video Doorbell Camera</h3>
<div class="product-description">At under $100, this feature-packed, subscription-free doorbell offers a lot of value, including free local recording, 24/7 recording, and smart alerts, plus a robust smart home ecosystem. It’s big, you need a microSD card for recording, and there’s no HDR, but it’s a solid choice.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25572846/247214_Tapo_video_doorbells_JTuohy_0006.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>
<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8MKQ5RC/"> <strike>$99.99</strike> $89.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/cloud-camera/tapo-d225/"> <strike>$99.99</strike> $89.99 at <strong>Tapo</strong></a></li></ul></div>
<p><em><em><strong>Video quality:</strong>&nbsp;2K HD (no HDR) /&nbsp;<strong>Smart alerts: </strong>People, packages, pets, vehicles (free) <strong>Aspect ratio:</strong>&nbsp;</em>4:3<em> /&nbsp;<strong>Field of view:</strong>&nbsp;180 degrees horizontal /&nbsp;<strong>Power options:</strong>&nbsp;Battery, wired trickle charge /&nbsp;<strong>Wi-Fi:</strong>&nbsp;2.4GHz /&nbsp;<strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;microSD card or cloud /&nbsp;<strong>Subscription fee:</strong>&nbsp;$2.79 a month&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Works with:</strong>&nbsp;Amazon Alexa, Google Home</em></em></p>

<p>You can use any doorbell on this list without a subscription, but you may sacrifice features like smart alerts, recorded video, and 24/7 continuous recording. If you want these but don’t want to pay a monthly fee, TP-Link’s Tapo D225 is an excellent choice.</p>

<p>A wired and battery-powered doorbell, the D225 offers free smart alerts for people, packages, pets, and vehicles and can record locally to a microSD card (purchased separately) without paying a subscription. There is an optional cloud service if you want to store your video offsite that also adds rich notifications (where a clip or image shows in the notification), but no other features are locked behind a paywall.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>It is a chunky doorbell and may not meet the spousal approval factor</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>To get the free recording of motion-activated events, you just need to insert a microSD card (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B09X7C2GBC">up to 512GB</a>) into the doorbell. While it can run on its built-in 10,000mAh battery, you will need to wire it up for continuous 24/7 recording. This will also trickle charge the battery, and the doorbell will still work and record video, even if your power and Wi-Fi go out.</p>

<p>There are a few hoops to jump through to get 24/7 recording working, which can be a bit confusing in the slightly cluttered Tapo app. However, once set up, it will capture everything that happens. This is a great option, considering Nest charges $15 a month for 24/7 recording.</p>

<p>The D225 also provides good video quality, a decent zoom, and a nice 4:3 aspect ratio that clearly shows your entire porch from top to bottom and a good view from side to side. There is no HDR imaging, though, so if your porch is covered, it can be hard to make out faces in some lights.</p>

<p>The doorbell can work with your existing chime (although, oddly, not if you enable 24/7 recording) but also comes with a plug-in chime. If you don’t wire it, you’ll have to remove it to charge, but the large battery can last up to eight months. The downside is that it is a huge, chunky doorbell, which may not meet the spousal approval factor for a good-looking doorbell.</p>

<p>Another neat feature of the Tapo is doorbell calling. When someone rings your doorbell, the alert comes in like a phone call, making it less likely that you’ll miss it. This is something first offered on Arlo buzzers, and Ring says it’s bringing it to its line.</p>

<p>As Tapo also offers a wide range of smart home products — including security cameras, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/17/23357060/tp-link-tapo-l930-review-apple-home-smart-lighting">smart lights</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23590959/tp-link-tapo-robot-vacuum-rv10-price-specs">robot vacuum cleaners</a> — you can tie your doorbell into smart home routines.</p>

<p>If you have lots of devices, the Tapo app can get a bit cluttered. But it’s easy enough to use and packed with features, including quick replies, a privacy mode that turns the camera off, and the ability to schedule notifications, set detection zones, and specify the type of alert you want to get from each one (e.g., only notify me if you see people in this zone and packages in this zone).</p>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Reolink Battery Doorbell</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Reolink is sleeker than the Tapo, with very good video quality and HDR support but no 24/7 recording.

<p>The <strong>second-generation </strong>Ring Wired Doorbell Pro — previously my top pick — is the best wired doorbell camera that works with Amazon Alexa and integrates with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Alarm-Base-Station-v2/dp/B0839ZRS29">Ring Alarm</a> and other Ring cameras. It’s more expensive than the Nest Wired — which also works with Alexa — but its video is higher quality and much brighter.</p>

<p>It has an ideal square aspect ratio for a full front porch view, speedy notifications, and impressively accurate motion detection using three separate sensors — radar, video analysis, and passive infrared. It also has a nice slim design and multiple faceplate options to fit your decor.</p>

<p>But there’s no free video recording, no option for 24/7 recording (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24259779/ring-24-7-continuous-recording-smart-security-cameras">yet</a>), and the smart alerts are limited to people and packages. However, you can now search for things like vehicles and animals after the fact with Ring’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265564/ring-ai-smart-video-search-security-camera-price-availability">Smart Video Search feature</a>. This makes tracking down my cat or checking which delivery driver came by a little easier.</p>

<p>The Ring Pro also works with Samsung SmartThings, and while it doesn’t support Apple Home, it can be integrated with extra hardware. There’s no support for Google Home.</p>

<p>A true wired doorbell, the Ring Pro is one of the most responsive doorbells I’ve tested, delivering notifications immediately. It also has the best range and connectivity, and built-in, full-color preroll helps ensure you don’t miss any crucial action.</p>

<p>The Pro has good color night vision, dual-band Wi-Fi, and smart responses (which let your doorbell talk to your visitor for you). The Ring app is best in class, and there are pages of settings you can tinker with. Plus, the timeline view for scrolling through your recordings is very good.</p>

<p>The Pro will work with your existing doorbell chime, plus Ring sells a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Chime/dp/B09L45VFCN">plug-in Chime</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Chime-Pro/dp/B07WML2XTD">Chime Wi-Fi extender</a> that can help boost connectivity while providing a selection of fun doorbell tones.</p>

<p>As with most doorbell cameras, the Pro can use Echo smart speakers to announce when someone is at the door. As a Ring doorbell, it can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22949565/doorbell-video-nest-echo-show-alexa-google-how-to">automatically pull up a live feed of your front door on an Echo Show</a>&nbsp;or Fire TV-enabled television when someone presses the doorbell.</p>

<p>The downside is that the Pro is expensive. Its subscription fee starts at <a href="https://ring.com/support/articles/v5hc7/introducing-ring-home-plans">$4.99 a month</a> (or $49.99 a year). This adds recorded footage, smart alerts, and an extra six seconds of preroll video, which, in lieu of 24/7 recording, provides plenty of time around motion events to catch all the action.</p>

<p>The Pro works with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692073/ring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features">Ring Edge</a>&nbsp;for local storage and video processing, plus the option of cellular backup. But you need a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa">Ring Alarm Pro</a> and <a href="https://ring.com/support/articles/v5hc7/introducing-ring-home-plans">Ring Home Premium subscription for this</a>, which costs $20 a month and no longer includes professional monitoring of your alarm (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260773/amazon-ring-alarm-price-hike-dark-pattern">that’s now a $10 add-on</a>).</p>

<p>The Ecobee Smart Doorbell Camera is a great wired doorbell camera and the only one that can use an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23919864/ecobee-smart-doorbell-camera-review#:~:text=The%20live%20view%20feature%20will%20work%20on%20the%20Premium%2C%20Enhanced%2C%20and%20Smart%20Thermostat%20with%20Voice%2C">Ecobee thermostat</a> as a video intercom — a neat feature. It sends fast, accurate alerts for people and packages, and thanks to radar detection and computer vision motion detection, it never once sent me a false alert.</p>

<p>The Ecobee has a comprehensive 187-degree diagonal field of view that lets you see top to bottom and side to side and offers decent 1080p HD video. A subscription is required for viewing recorded video, $5 a month / $50 a year, but alerts for people and packages are free. In 2024, Ecobee introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276776/ecobee-yale-august-smart-lock-doorbell-partnership">the ability to control your Yale or August Wi-Fi-enabled door lock</a> directly from its app, so you can more easily unlock the door for someone from afar.</p>

<p>One quirk is that while the Ecobee records all motion (if you subscribe), it only alerts you if it sees people or packages. This does cut down on the number of alerts you get, but I’d like the option to turn motion alerts on, mainly so I can know when my dog has gotten out and is sitting at my front door (especially because there are no animal or vehicle alerts). The doorbell does record all motion events for up to two minutes, so you can go back and view them, but you won’t get notified.</p>

<p>The Ecobee works with Apple Home and can ring a HomePod as a chime (as well as your existing chime), plus pull up a live view on your Apple TV. But it doesn’t support <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/set-up-homekit-secure-video-mm7c90d21583/icloud">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, so you have to pay Ecobee’s subscription fee if you want recorded videos. It also works with Amazon Alexa and recently added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663489/ecobee-smart-doorbell-camera-google-home-integration">support for Google Home</a>. If you have an Ecobee thermostat in a convenient location, this is an excellent option.</p>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Aqara G4 Video Doorbell</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Aqara G4 is an inexpensive HomeKit Secure Video doorbell that also works with Alexa and Google Home. It’s powered by batteries, wires or both, and offers 24/7 local recording. But a 16:9 aspect ratio and poorer video quality let it down. </div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24522639/236582_Aqara_Video_Doorbell_G4_JTuohy_0002.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<p><em><em><strong>Video quality:</strong>&nbsp;1080p /&nbsp;<strong>Smart Alerts: </strong>Person, facial recognition and person, facial recognition, packages with HSV, / <strong>Aspect ratio:</strong>&nbsp;16:9 /&nbsp;<strong>Field of view:</strong>&nbsp;162 degrees horizontal /&nbsp;<strong>Power options:</strong>&nbsp;Wired or battery /&nbsp;<strong>Wi-Fi:</strong>&nbsp;2.4GHz /&nbsp;<strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;Cloud and local /&nbsp;<strong>Subscription fee:</strong>&nbsp;Seven days of free cloud storage or 99 cents a month with&nbsp;iCloud /&nbsp;<strong>Works with:</strong>&nbsp;Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home</em></em></p>

<p>Aqara’s G4 is currently the best video doorbell for Apple Home users, especially if you want 24/7 video recording. It’s also<strong> </strong>the only battery-powered doorbell that’s compatible with Apple Home, and it works with HomeKit Secure Video.</p>

<p>It runs on six standard AA batteries and can be hardwired to support 24/7 video recording (through Aqara’s app, though, not in Apple Home). It’s jam-packed with features, but it’s probably best suited for those who live in apartments as its landscape aspect ratio means it can’t really see packages at the doorstep, and it’s not very weather-resistant.</p>

<p>At $120, it’s the least expensive HomeKit option and pairs with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock#:~:text=Aqara%20Smart%20Lock%20U100&amp;text=The%20Aqara%20is%20a%20fully,up%20the%20price%20and%20complexity.">Aqara U100 smart lock</a> (which also works with Apple Home and Home Key) for a nice, fully Apple Home-compatible setup on your front door. As a bonus, you can easily unlock the door from the same screen as viewing your doorbell footage.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24522643/236582_Aqara_Video_Doorbell_G4_JTuohy_0006.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The G4 can be powered by wires as a true wired doorbell, or by six AA batteries, or both!&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge" data-portal-copyright="Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge" />
<p>Downsides include a 16:9 aspect ratio (a problem if you want to see packages on your porch), no HDR imaging, which delivers pretty bad video quality, and a finicky chime box that has to be plugged in inside and near the doorbell. That chime also houses a microSD card, which is required for 24/7 recording. Unfortunately, the G4 can’t ring an existing electronic chime, but the chime box is plenty loud, and you can customize the heck out of the sounds.</p>

<p>The G4 has smart alerts for people, packages, animals, and vehicles, facial recognition, and the option to announce who is at the door on a connected HomePod or HomePod Mini (you need an Apple Home hub to use this in HomeKit).</p>

<p>It responded quickly to doorbell rings and motion alerts, but I had some connectivity issues. Plus, occasionally, I got an overheating warning while testing in May 2024 — and that was before the heatwave we experienced in South Carolina this summer.</p>

<p>Aqara has its own app, which has a ton of innovative features, including custom ringtones for different people, a voice changer, and the option to have your smart home devices react depending on who is at the front door.</p>

<p>The Aqara app adds access to 24/7 video, a nice feature to have, especially for free. The implementation is spotty, and video quality is not great, but it will do in a pinch. In addition to Apple Home, the Aqara doorbell works with Google Home and Amazon Alexa.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Note: Aqara announced the $129.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24334060/aqara-doorbell-camera-hub-g410-smart-home-hub-ces">Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410</a> earlier this year, which adds 2K video quality, a 4:3 aspect ratio, and end-to-end encryption of video.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Eufy’s FamiLock S3 Max is a two-in-one video doorbell and smart lock that manages to handle both functions pretty well. Its $399 price tag may cause sticker shock at first but is easier to accept when you consider the price of a smart door lock and video doorbell together. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The FamiLock S3 Max has a 4-inch screen that shows a live video feed of what’s captured by the front camera, so you can check it at a glance without opening your phone. The screen also allows other people in your household to check who’s at the door without having Eufy’s app installed, which is especially helpful for kids and guests. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can unlock the FamiLock S3 Max using an app, PIN code, key, or palm recognition, which works by using infrared light to scan the vascular patterns beneath the palm of your hand. Using palm recognition doesn’t require you to physically touch the door lock and can be more reliable than a fingerprint reader for older folks whose fingerprints have degraded over time. It took a little time to get used to unlocking my door this way, but it worked reliably once I did. To lock the door, you’ll need to push a button on the lock, or enable auto-lock within Eufy’s app.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Running both a video doorbell and smart lock takes a lot of power, and in our tests, the FamiLock S3 Max’s battery was down to 41 percent after one month. It does have four AAA batteries to keep basic functions operational while you charge the lock’s main battery. You can also pick up a spare battery <a href="https://www.eufy.com/products/t85v0111-82">from Eufy</a> for $37 if you want to have a fully charged backup at all times. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In our tests, the FamiLock S3 Max recorded clear video both day and night, though a protruding door frame blocked part of the camera. You can save video footage for free within Eufy’s app because it’s stored locally rather than in the cloud. You’ll receive an alert when people or motion are detected, but the video doorbell can’t recognized specific events, like package recognition. Hooking it up to Eufy’s <a href="https://www.eufy.com/products/t80301d1?variant=41846278357178">HomeBase 3</a> enables some smart alerts, including pet and vehicle detection and facial recognition, but will set you back $150. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can view a live feed from the camera on an Amazon Alexa or Google Home smart speaker with a screen, but I found it easier to just check the display built into the smart lock. Apple Home support is available on the smart lock portion of the FamiLock S3 Max, but not the video doorbell. Still, if you want both a smart lock and video doorbell without having to install and manage two separate devices, Eufy’s FamiLock S3 Max is a compelling choice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Un360w">Other doorbell cameras to consider</h2>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://reolink.com/us/product/reolink-video-doorbell-wifi/">The Reolink Video Doorbell</a> (starting at $119) is a wired version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYGVPLLT">Reolink’s battery model</a> mentioned above. It’s worth considering if you can use Power over Ethernet (there’s also a Wi-Fi version). There’s also the option of dual-band Wi-Fi, local storage to a microSD card or FTP server, and 24/7 recording with compatible hardware. I tested the black Wi-Fi version <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Doorbell-Detection-Storage-Assistant/dp/B0B7S3JSG7/">($119.99)</a>, which streams good 2K video but only supports person detection (which is fairly inaccurate) and has a more horizontal field of view. The white model has package detection and a more vertical field of view. The battery Reolink adds animal and vehicle alerts and has a better field of view, so it’s the better choice unless you want PoE.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tapo-Spotlights-Ultra-Wide-Detection-D210/dp/B0D8M6GNP3/">Tapo D210</a> ($59.99) is a battery-powered doorbell with a similar design to the D225, but there’s no wiring option, so it can’t record 24/7. It does have free local recording with a microSD card and free alerts for people, pets, and vehicles, but there’s no package detection. Its rectangular 16:9 aspect ratio shows less of my porch, and it’s only available in white. While it has a few more features than the similarly priced Blink, it is very big and bulky, has a shorter battery life, and can’t be wired to trickle-charge or ring your existing chime (it does come with a plug-in chime). </li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24223639/ring-battery-doorbell-camera-price-release-date-specs">Ring Battery Doorbell</a> ($99.99) suffers badly from the back-of-the-head problem common with battery-powered buzzers. Other than that, it’s a fine basic buzzer, but it doesn’t have removable batteries. While the redesigned quick-release system makes it easier to remove the doorbell to charge, the Plus is worth the extra money for the added convenience and better video resolution. The one thing this Ring has going for it is its slim profile, which makes it a good option if you want something more discreet.</li>



<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/reviews/google-nest-doorbell-battery-review-2715">Google Nest Doorbell (battery)</a>&nbsp;is worth considering if you are in a Google household and can’t wire your doorbell, but it is big and bulky. Plus, you have to remove it to charge. Specs and price-wise, it’s the same as my top pick, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23404602/google-nest-doorbell-wired-review-hello">Nest Doorbell (wired)</a>, but it can’t record 24/7, which the wired Nest can. It’s also twice the size of the wired model. </li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Battery-Powered-Detection-Recognition/dp/B099RX62SC">Eufy Video Doorbell Dual</a> is a previous pick that doesn’t require any monthly fees and records footage locally. But at $250, it’s very expensive, and there are now better, cheaper options. It’s still great thanks to its dual camera feature that lets you see your porch and your visitor with a wide view, plus free smart alerts, including facial recognition and a neat uncollected package alert. It’s worth considering if you already have a Eufy HomeBase. You can read my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22939350/eufy-dual-video-doorbell-review-price-release-date">full review here</a>.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915876/wyze-video-doorbell-pro-review-budget-doorbell-camera">Wyze Video Doorbell Pro</a> is a battery buzzer with impressive features for its price, and if you hardwire it, you get preroll video. However, a five-minute cooldown period between recordings, unless you pay for a subscription, is an inexcusable amount of time that negates its offer of “free recording.” Plus, Wyze has had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/19/24077233/wyze-security-camera-breach-13000-customers-events">some major security issues in the past</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="HTDYJ8">Doorbell cameras we’re currently testing</h2>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Blink <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676241/blink-launches-second-gen-video-doorbell-with-person-detection">launched an upgraded version</a> of its doorbell in May.

It requires a Sync Module to work, which the current version doesn’t.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-Doorbell-Wireless-Supports-Assistant/dp/B0F6CJ93GS">Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410</a> ($129.99) is an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24334060/aqara-doorbell-camera-hub-g410-smart-home-hub-ces">upgrade to the G4</a>. It offers 2K video quality, a 4:3 aspect ratio, and end-to-end encryption, along with a mmWave sensor for more accurate person detection. Uniquely, it uses dual-band Wi-Fi and is a Zigbee, Thread, and Matter smart home hub for Aqara’s wide smart home system.</li>



<li>The&nbsp;Arlo Video Doorbell (wired / wireless)&nbsp;is the second generation of the excellent Arlo Essential wired, which was a former pick in this guide. It doesn’t have the option of wiring only; instead, it’s a battery doorbell you can wire to trickle-charge and comes in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Doorbell-Wireless-Integrated-Notifications/dp/B0DVTGJ143">1080p</a> ($79.99) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Doorbell-Generation-Detection-AVDK4001-100CNS/dp/B0C683F516">2K</a><strong> </strong>($129.99) version.</li>

<li>Ring’s third-generation Wired Doorbell Pro is the company’s first model that can record video in 4K. It features 10x zoom, better recording quality in low light, and 3D motion detection that’s meant to reduce unnecessary notifications. It’s available for $249.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Pro-2/dp/B086Q54K53">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/ring-wired-doorbell-pro-3rd-gen-retinal-4k-for-ultra-clear-video-10x-zoom-low-light-sight-for-color-night-vision-deep-silver/J39TLS6RRX">Best Buy</a>, and from <a href="https://ring.com/products/wired-doorbell-pro" data-type="link" data-id="https://ring.com/products/wired-doorbell-pro">Ring’s store</a>.</li>



<li>The third-generation Google Nest Video Doorbell has the same smart home control features as its predecessor, but it can record 2K video (up from 960p) and has a wider and taller field of view. You can get 24 / 7 recordings with a Google Home Premium Advanced subscription ($20 per month / $200 per year). The wired model is available for $179.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Doorbell-Wired-3rd/dp/B0FN7FK9G4">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-nest-doorbell-wired-3rd-gen-latest-model-2k-video-and-gemini-snow/J39TC8J8TF/sku/6642764">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-doorbell-wired-3rd-gen-2k-video-and-gemini-hazel/-/A-94859111">Target</a>.</li>

The deal knocks the yearly price <a href="https://www.walmart.com/plus">down to $49 ($49 off)</a>, which will automatically renew at the regular price next year if you decide to continue your subscription.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Walmart Plus</h3>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Walmart-Plus-stock-image.png?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="A Walmart Plus stock image with groceries and other kitchen items." /></figure>
<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/plus"> <strike>$98</strike> $49 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li></ul></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Walmart Plus offers a number of enticing perks, including free delivery on orders over $35, free shipping with no order minimum, an ad-supported membership to either Paramount Plus or Peacock, and more. Walmart Plus members also get access to limited-time offers, like five free months of Apple Music. And if you’re on the hunt for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/814345/black-friday-best-early-deals-2025">early Black Friday deals</a>, Walmart Plus members can get early access to Black Friday discounts five hours before the general public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking of which, Walmart is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores">planning to roll out</a> its Black Friday deals in waves, beginning online at 7PM ET on Thursday, November 13th, for Walmart Plus subscribers. For everybody else, the early deals will kick off on November 14th at 12AM ET, and will run both in-store and online through November 16th. There will be a second wave of deals before the event officially kicks off online and in-store at 12AM ET on November 28th and lasts through November 30th.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you do a lot of shopping at the retailer, grabbing this discount is a great way to save during the holidays and throughout the year. Just remember to set a reminder for this time next year, so you can assess whether you want to continue paying for a membership before it automatically renews at full price.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google started rolling out its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788102/gemini-for-home-new-google-assistant-launch-date-price-features">Gemini voice assistant</a> for its smart speakers two weeks ago and, in a <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Gemini-for-Home-voice-assistant-Two-Week-Recap/ba-p/762504?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8Ym9hcmRfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1IVEJZT084OTVRQk5EfDc2MjUwNHxTVUJTQ1JJUFRJT05TfGhL">blog post</a> marking the anniversary, the company seems to think everything is going great. It’s even quoting a user who said, “My Google Home just got upgraded with Gemini. It’s actually useful now beyond asking for today’s weather.” That’s some not-so-subtle shade right there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But dig <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Top-Questions-amp-Answers-about-Gemini-for-Home-Google-Home-Premium-and/ba-p/750844">into the post’s FAQ</a>, and things don’t look so rosy. Two of the most frequently asked questions from those who have the new assistant are:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Gemini for Home voice assistant is not fully understanding my query… (Example: I tried to set an alarm for 5pm but it set it for 5am.)</li>



<li>Gemini for Home voice assistant is not properly controlling my home devices. What should I do?</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not great.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Controlling connected devices such as lights and locks, and doing what you ask it to do, are two very basic requirements of a voice assistant in the home. And Gemini will be the new default voice assistant on all Google Home smart speakers and displays, so it really needs to do those two things well. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gemini’s launch is part of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788102/gemini-for-home-new-google-assistant-launch-date-price-features">Gemini for Home overhaul of Google Home</a>. This brings Gemini’s AI-powered smarts to the Google Home app in the form of a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789412/new-nest-cams-nest-doorbell-launch-price-specs-release-date#:~:text=Alongside%20the%20hardware,features%20more%20quickly.">Ask Home chatbot interface</a>, which gives you access to the Google Home app’s capabilities using natural language text commands.

To get the Gemini voice assistant, however, you need to go through a convoluted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808858/google-gemini-for-home-early-access-launch">Early Access sign-up process</a> that started on October 28th, and is entirely separate from its <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697?hl=en">Public Preview program</a>. Then you wait. </p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/IMG_0189.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Gemini voice assistant won’t be available for everyone until next Spring., when Google launches its new Google Home smart speaker.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the vein of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684560/amazon-alexa-plus-one-million-users-coming-summer-2025">Amazon with its Alexa Plu</a>s, Gemini is rolling out <em>very slowly</em> to smart speakers. No one at <em>The Verge</em> has it yet, and based on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/">Google Home subreddit</a>, it&#8217;s not arrived for many other users either. Google has indicated it won’t launch for everyone until next spring at the earliest, when its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788085/hands-on-google-home-speaker">Google Home smart speaker should arrive</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Gemini does land on your devices, it should bring an entirely new voice assistant to Google’s smart displays and smart speakers. <em>The Verge</em> saw a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/788085/hands-on-google-home-speaker">preview last month</a> and heard a more conversational assistant that can understand natural language and interpret context. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google says Gemini will also be better at controlling your smart home, in part, because you won’t have to use specific wording to get it to do what you want, and can issue multiple commands at once. So, in theory, a command like “Hey Google, turn on the lights, except in the bedroom, turn on the TV, lock the front door, and make it warmer in here” should now work. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, we haven&#8217;t been able to test this, and some early comments on Reddit indicated that daisy-chaining any commands <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1otgpbo/gemininot_perfectbut_okay/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">isn’t working yet</a>. A limited version of this feature was already part of Google Assistant. Meaning, Gemini may have actually gone backwards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you have Gemini on your smart speakers, we want to hear about your experience with it so far. Comment here or email me at <a href="mailto:jennifer.tuohy@theverge.com">jennifer.tuohy@theverge.com</a>. If you’re not sure, just ask your speaker: “Ok Google, who are you?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A smarter home</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hitting hurdles with smart home control is likely one reason Gemini is rolling out slowly. As we’ve seen from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/787171/amazon-alexa-plus-hardware-event-smart-home#:~:text=Some%20basic%20features%20that%20used%20to%20work%20reliably%20now%20don%E2%80%99t%20or%20require%20new%20phrasing%20every%20time.%20My%20struggles%20to%20control%20my%20Alexa%2Denabled%20coffee%20machine%20persist%2C%20and%20I%20can%E2%80%99t%20get%20Alexa%20to%20consistently%20turn%20on%20my%20bathroom%20fan%20for%20a%20set%20period%20of%20time.">Alexa Plus’s rollout,</a> generative AI and smart home are not easy bedfellows. The old Google Assistant and the original Alexa were built on a command-and-control infrastructure: when this statement occurs, do this. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new, generative-AI-powered LLM assistants <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/796138/alexa-plus-gemini-for-home-problmes-solutions-smart-home">don’t operate the same way,</a> and what gives these systems the ability to be more conversational and understand context also gives them a lot more room for error. “LLMs are great at being creative, but not so good at doing the same thing over and over again with the same predictable output,” Google Home’s Anish Kattukaran told<em> The Verge</em> in an interview.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This challenge is clearly something both Amazon and Google are still trying to overcome. Based on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/787171/amazon-alexa-plus-hardware-event-smart-home#:~:text=Some%20basic%20features%20that%20used%20to%20work%20reliably%20now%20don%E2%80%99t%20or%20require%20new%20phrasing%20every%20time.%20My%20struggles%20to%20control%20my%20Alexa%2Denabled%20coffee%20machine%20persist%2C%20and%20I%20can%E2%80%99t%20get%20Alexa%20to%20consistently%20turn%20on%20my%20bathroom%20fan%20for%20a%20set%20period%20of%20time.">my testing of Alexa Plus</a> and the early indications around the Gemini voice assistant’s capabilities, there’s still a long way to go before we can confidently leave our smart homes in the hands of this new breed of AI assistant. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Information</em> says that the company was aiming to announce a new iPhone Air next fall that would be lighter and have more battery capacity than this year’s model. The new phone would also have gotten a vapor chamber, like the iPhone 17 Pro lineup this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with no second-generation iPhone Air, Apple’s fall 2026 iPhone lineup will apparently consist of the iPhone 18 Pro and its foldable iPhone, while the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18E will launch in spring 2027. However, according to one of <em>The Information’s</em> sources, Apple may still launch this new iPhone Air as soon as spring 2027.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gemini for TV is rolling out to Google TV Streamer devices <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/google-tv-streamer-gemini-tv-now-available/">starting today,</a> allowing almost anyone to try it out. Since it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782500/google-gemini-ai-assistant-smart-tv-tcl">launched back in September</a>, Gemini for TV has only been available on a limited number of smart TVs. If you didn’t have one of those devices, you were out of luck. Gemini for TV will soon be much more widely available — all you need is a TV with an HDMI port to connect a Google TV Streamer to, <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7022492?hl=en" data-type="link" data-id="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7022492?hl=en">HDCP 1.3 or later</a>, and a reliable internet connection. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gemini for TV replaces Google Assistant, offering the same basic voice assistant capabilities but with a more conversational tone. For instance, you can ask Gemini for TV to suggest a movie for you and a friend to watch based on your preferred genres, or ask it to summarize the last season of a show you’re watching. You can also use Gemini for TV for smart home tasks, such as showing you a camera feed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gemini for TV will be rolling out “over the next few weeks” to Google TV Streamer devices, so don’t worry if you don’t have it on your device yet. You can check to see if the update’s available by <a href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/16522213">going into the settings</a> on your Google TV Streamer, selecting your account from “Accounts &amp; Profiles,” and selecting “Voice Assistant.” If your device is eligible for the update, you should see an option for “Gemini for TV.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/814345/black-friday-best-early-deals-2025">dozens of solid deals trickle in ahead of Black Friday</a>, but <strong>Apple’s AirPods 4 </strong>hitting a new all-time low is the first one that&#8217;s really stood out to me. Right now, you can buy Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds for just $84.99 ($44 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/apple-airpods-4-white/JJGCQ83JQ5/sku/6447384">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-4-with-Active-Noise-Cancellation/11381374703">Walmart</a>, which beats the previous Prime Big Deal Days record low by $5.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Apple AirPods 4</h3>
<div class="product-description">Apple’s AirPods 4 improve on previous models with better sound, clearer voice calls, and an even more comfortable design. For $50 extra, you can purchase a model with active noise cancellation and wireless charging. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review">Read our review.</a></div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AirPods42.webp?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want a reliable pair of wireless earbuds that play well with Apple’s ecosystem, the AirPods 4 are one of the best options under $100 you can get. They don’t offer active noise cancellation like the higher-end models, but they do deliver better sound than Apple’s previous entry-level buds with noticeably richer bass. If you rely on earbuds for calls, they now include the Pro’s Voice Isolation tech, which cuts background noise far more effectively than prior entry-level model’s, and Apple has added new head-gesture controls so you can answer calls or dismiss notifications with a nod.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You also get a more robust IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, meaning they can handle sweaty workouts and light rain. Plus, they integrate well with other Apple devices, offering automatic switching, audio sharing, Apple TV integration, and more.</p>
